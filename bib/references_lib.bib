  abstract = {Abstract             The Archaea occupy a key position in the Tree of Life, and are a major fraction of microbial diversity. Abundant in soils, ocean sediments and the water column, they have crucial roles in processes mediating global carbon and nutrient fluxes. Moreover, they represent an important component of the human microbiome, where their role in health and disease is still unclear. The development of culture-independent sequencing techniques has provided unprecedented access to genomic data from a large number of so far inaccessible archaeal lineages. This is revolutionizing our view of the diversity and metabolic potential of the Archaea in a wide variety of environments, an important step toward understanding their ecological role. The archaeal tree is being rapidly filled up with new branches constituting phyla, classes and orders, generating novel challenges for high-rank systematics, and providing key information for dissecting the origin of this domain, the evolutionary trajectories that have shaped its current diversity, and its relationships with Bacteria and Eukarya. The present picture is that of a huge diversity of the Archaea, which we are only starting to explore.},

Using 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) and iTAG sequencing analyses of nearly 4 years of monthly sampling through the water column (5–80 m depth), we found a clear partitioning of community composition that could be attributed to dissolved oxygen (Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.578) in comparison to other environmental variables, such as light, fluorescence, temperature, salinity, microbial abundance or nutrients. Bacteroidetes (orders Sphingobacteriales and Flavobacteriales), SAR11 (subclades Ia Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique and II), an unclassified group of Alphaproteobacteria, and SAR86 dominated in waters containing dissolved oxygen concentrations ≥70 μM. In contrast, taxonomic groups associated with capabilities of either oxidative or reductive cycling of inorganic sulfur dominated in waters with dissolved oxygen from \textasciitilde 70 μM to undetectable levels. The dominant groups were Arctic96BD-19, SUP05 and SAR324 (sulfur oxidation) and Desulfobacterales (sulfate reduction). Desulfobacterales are known to come primarily from sulfidic, nitrate/nitrite-depleted waters and sediments. Their presence, therefore, provides taxonomic evidence for pelagic dissimilatory sulfate reduction within oxygen-depleted coastal environments.},

  abstract = {Understanding the emergence of life from (primitive) abiotic components has arguably been one of the deepest and yet one of the most elusive scientific questions. Notwithstanding the lack of a clear definition for a living system, it is widely argued that heredity (involving selfreproduction) along with compartmentalization and metabolism are key features that contrast living systems from their non-living counterparts. A minimal living system may be viewed as “a selfsustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution”. It has been proposed that autocatalytic sets of chemical reactions (ACSs) could serve as a mechanism to establish chemical compositional identity, heritable self-reproduction, and evolution in a minimal chemical system. Following years of theoretical work, autocatalytic chemical systems have been constructed experimentally using a wide variety of substrates, and most studies, thus far, have focused on the demonstration of chemical self-reproduction under specific conditions. While several recent experimental studies have raised the possibility of carrying out some aspects of experimental evolution using autocatalytic reaction networks, there remain many open challenges. In this review, we start by evaluating theoretical studies of ACSs specifically with a view to establish the conditions required for such chemical systems to exhibit self-reproduction and Darwinian evolution. Then, we follow with an extensive overview of experimental ACS systems and use the theoretically established conditions to critically evaluate these empirical systems for their potential to exhibit Darwinian evolution. We identify various technical and conceptual challenges limiting experimental progress and, finally, conclude with some remarks about open questions.},

A universal description of adaptation-capable chemical reaction network (CRN) structures has remained elusive until now, since currently-known criteria for adaptation apply only to a tiny subset of possible CRNs. Here we identify the definitive structural requirements that characterize all adaptation-capable collections of interacting molecules, however large or complex. We show that these network structures implement a form of integral control in which multiple independent integrals can collaborate to confer the capacity for adaptation on specific molecules. Using an algebraic algorithm informed by these findings, we demonstrate the existence of embedded integrals in a variety of biologically important CRNs that have eluded previous methods, and for which adaptation has been observed experimentally. This definitive picture of biological adaptation at the level of intermolecular interactions represents a blueprint for adaptation-capable signaling networks across all domains of life, and for the design of synthetic biosystems.},

Input concentrations of adenosine monophosphate and citrate were externally varied over time, and their concentrations in the reactor and the response of eight other species were measured. Multidimensional scaling analysis and heuristic algorithms applied to two-species time-lagged correlation functions derived from the time series yielded a diagram from which the interactions among all of the species could be deduced. The diagram predicts essential features of the known reaction network in regard to chemical reactions and interactions among the measured species. The approach is applicable to many complex reaction systems.},

This review gives an impression of the state of the art of the field by showing a diverse number of recent highlights, including out-of-equilibrium self-assembly, chemically fuelled molecular motion, compartmentalised chemical networks and designed oscillators. Subsequently a number of current challenges related to the design of complex chemical systems are discussed, including those of creating concurrent formation–destruction systems, continuously maintaining chemical systems away from equilibrium, incorporating feedback loops and pushing replication chemistry away from equilibrium. Finally, the prospects for Systems Chemistry are discussed including the tantalizing vision of the               de novo               synthesis of life and the idea of self-synthesising and self-repairing chemical factories.},

Organic matter (OM) stoichiometry had been thought to control the balance between the two major nitrogen removal pathways—denitrification and anammox—but the expected proportion of 30\% anammox derived from mean oceanic OM is rarely observed in the environment. With incubations designed to directly test the effects of stoichiometry, however, we showed that the ratio of anammox to denitrification depends on the stoichiometry of OM supply, as predicted. Furthermore, observed rates of nitrogen loss increase with the magnitude of OM supply. The variable ratios between denitrification and anammox previously observed in the ocean are thus attributable to localized variations in OM quality and quantity and do not necessitate a revision to the global nitrogen cycle.},

We used isotope tracers to directly measure N               2               O reduction rates in the eastern tropical North Pacific. Because of incomplete denitrification, N               2               O cycling rates are an order of magnitude higher than predicted by current models in suboxic regions, and the spatial distribution suggests strong dependence on both organic carbon and dissolved oxygen concentrations.

  abstract = {There are two fundamental requirements for life as we know it, liquid water and organic polymers, such as nucleic acids and proteins. Water provides the medium for chemical reactions and the polymers carry out the central biological functions of replication and catalysis. During the accretionary phase of the Earth, high surface temperatures would have made the presence of liquid water and an extensive organic carbon reservoir unlikely. As the Earth’s surface cooled, water and simple organic compounds, derived from a variety of sources, would have begun to accumulate. This set the stage for the process of chemical evolution to begin in which one of the central facets was the synthesis of biologically important polymers, some of which had a variety of simple catalytic functions. Increasingly complex macromolecules were produced and eventually molecules with the ability to catalyze their own imperfect replication appeared. Thus began the processes of multiplication, heredity and variation, and this marked the point of both the origin of life and evolution. Once simple self-replicating entities originated, they evolved first into the RNA World and eventually to the DNA/Protein World, which had all the attributes of modern biology. If the basic components water and organic polymers were, or are, present on other bodies in our solar system and beyond, it is reasonable to assume that a similar series of steps that gave rise of life on Earth could occur elsewhere.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             The probability that life spontaneously emerges in a suitable environment (abiogenesis) is one of the major unknowns in astrobiology. Assessing its value is impeded by the lack of an accepted theory for the origin of life, and is further complicated by the existence of selection biases. Appealing uncritically to some version of the ‘Principle of Mediocrity’ – namely, the supposed typicality of what transpired on Earth – is problematic on empirical or logical grounds. In this paper, we adopt a Bayesian statistical approach to put the inference of lower bounds for the probability of abiogenesis on a rigorous footing, based on current and future evidence. We demonstrate that the single datum that life has appeared at least once on Earth merely sets weak constraints on the minimal probability of abiogenesis. In fact, the a priori probability assigned to this event (viz., optimistic, pessimistic, or agnostic prior) exerts the strongest influence on the final result. We also show that the existence of a large number of habitable worlds does not necessarily imply, by itself, a high probability that life should be common in the universe. Instead, as delineated before, the choice of prior, which is subject to uncertainty (i.e. admits multiple scenarios), strongly influences the likelihood of life being common. If habitable worlds are uncommon, for an agnostic prior, a deterministic scenario for the origin of life might be favoured over one where abiogenesis is a fluke event.},

  abstract = {The formose reaction is an autocatalytic series of aldol condensations that allows one to obtain monosaccharides from formaldehyde. The formose reaction suffers from a lack of selectivity, which hinders practical applications at the industrial level. Over the years, many attempts have been made to overcome this selectivity issue, with modest results. Heterogeneous porous catalysts with acid–base properties, such as Metal–Organic Frameworks (MOFs), can offer advantages compared to homogeneous strong bases (e.g., calcium hydroxide) for increasing the selectivity of this important reaction. For the very first time, four different Zeolite Imidazolate Frameworks are presented in this work as catalysts for the formose reaction in liquid phase, and their catalytic performances were compared with those of the typical homogeneous catalyst (i.e., calcium hydroxide). The heterogeneous nature of the catalysis, the possible contribution of leached metal or linkers to the solution, and the stability of the materials were investigated. The porous structure of these solids and their mild basicity make them suitable for obtaining enhanced selectivity at 30\% formaldehyde conversion. Most of the MOFs tested showed low structural stability under reaction conditions, thereby indicating the need to search for new MOF families with higher robustness. However, this important result opens the path for future research on porous heterogeneous basic catalysts for the formose reaction.},

  abstract = {Coastal areas such as continental shelves, estuaries, deltas, fjords and lagoons can release high amounts of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. However, estimates of trace gas emissions are often biased by incomplete spatial and temporal coverages. Based on a compilation of literature data, the distributions of N2O and CH4 in European coastal areas (i.e. Arctic Ocean, Baltic Sea, North Sea, northeastern Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea) were reviewed and their emissions to the atmosphere reassessed. Maximum N2O saturations were found in estuarine systems, whereas the shelf waters, which are not influenced by freshwater plumes, are close to equilibrium with the atmosphere. This implies that N2O is mainly formed in estuarine systems. European coastal waters are a net source of N2O to the atmosphere (0.33e0.67 Tg N yearÀ1) with the major contribution coming from estuarine/river systems and not from open shelf areas. European shelf areas contribute significantly (up to 26\%) to the global oceanic N2O emissions. CH4 saturations show a high temporal and spatial variability with maximum values in estuarine/fjord systems. European coastal areas are a source of atmospheric CH4 (0.35e0.75 Tg C yearÀ1) and contribute significantly to the overall global CH4 oceanic emissions. However, this estimate still seems to be a severe underestimation since CH4 fluxes from estuaries and shallow seeps are not adequately represented. Future N2O and CH4 emissions from coastal areas strongly depend on the degree of eutrophication of coastal waters and might increase in the future.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important atmospheric trace gas involved in tropospheric warming and stratospheric ozone depletion. Estimates of the global ocean contribution to N2O emissions average 21\% (range: 10 to 53\%). Ongoing environmental changes such as warming, deoxygenation and acidification are affecting oceanic N2O cycling and emissions to the atmosphere. International activities over the last decades aimed at improving estimates of global N2O emissions, including (i) the MarinE MethanE and NiTrous Oxide database (MEMENTO) for archiving of quality-controlled data, and (ii) a recent large-scale inter-laboratory comparison by Working Group 143 of the Scientific Committee on Ocean Research (SCOR). To reduce uncertainties in oceanic N2O emission estimates and to characterize the spatial and temporal variability in N2O distributions in a changing ocean, we propose the establishment of a harmonized N2O Observation Network (N2O-ON) combining discrete and continuous data from various platforms. The network will integrate observations obtained by calibrated techniques, using time series measurements at fixed stations and repeated hydrographic sections on voluntary observing ships and research vessels. In addition to exploiting existing oceanographic infrastructure, we propose the establishment of central calibration facilities in selected international laboratories to improve accuracy, and ensure standardization and comparability of N2O measurements. Final data products will include a harmonized global N2O concentration and emission fields for use in model validation and projections of future oceanic N2O emissions, to inform the global research community and policy makers.},

The nucleotide was fully recovered by the two desorption stages, mostly by the NaOH extraction. The evidence at hand indicates that 5'-AMP reaction with clay is affected by electrostatic interactions involving both attraction and repulsion lbrces. Some specific adsorption, possibly the result of covalent bonding and complex formation with the adsorbed ion, cannot be ruled out for iron but does not appear to operate for calcium.

  abstract = {The ability to grow a microbe in the laboratory enables reproducible study and engineering of its genetics. Unfortunately, the majority of microbes in the tree of life remain uncultivated because of the effort required to identify culturing conditions. Predictions of viable growth conditions to guide experimental testing would be highly desirable. While carbon and energy sources can be computationally predicted with annotated genes, it is harder to predict other requirements for growth such as oxygen, temperature, salinity, and pH. Here, we developed genome-based computational models capable of predicting oxygen tolerance (92\% balanced accuracy), optimum temperature (R2=0.73), salinity (R2=0.81) and pH (R2=0.48) for novel taxonomic microbial families without requiring functional gene annotations. Using growth conditions and genome sequences of 15,596 bacteria and archaea, we found that amino acid frequencies are predictive of growth requirements. As little as two amino acids can predict oxygen tolerance with 88\% balanced accuracy. Using cellular localization of proteins to compute amino acid frequencies improved prediction of pH (R2 increase of 0.36). Because these models do not rely on the presence or absence of specific genes, they can be applied to incomplete genomes, requiring as little as 10\% completeness. We applied our models to predict growth requirements for all 85,205 species of sequenced bacteria and archaea and found that uncultivated species are enriched in thermophiles, anaerobes, and acidophiles. Finally, we applied our models to 3,349 environmental samples with metagenome-assembled genomes and showed that individual microbes within a community have differing growth requirements. This work guides identification of growth constraints for laboratory cultivation of diverse microbes.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) and ozone destructing agent; yet global estimates of N2O emissions are uncertain. Marine N2O stems from nitrification and denitrification processes which depend on organic matter cycling and dissolved oxygen (O2). We introduce N2O as an obligate intermediate product of denitrification and as an O2-dependent by-product from nitrification in the Bern3D ocean model. A large model ensemble is used to probabilistically constrain modern and to project marine N2O production for a low (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP)2.6) and high GHG (RCP8.5) scenario extended to A.D. 10,000. Water column N2O and surface ocean partial pressure N2O data serve as constraints in this Bayesian framework. The constrained median for modern N2O production is 4.5 (±1𝜎 range: 3.0 to 6.1) Tg N yr−1, where 4.5\% stems from denitrification. Modeled denitrification is 65.1 (40.9 to 91.6) Tg N yr−1, well within current estimates. For high GHG forcing, N2O production decreases by 7.7\% over this century due to decreasing organic matter export and remineralization. Thereafter, production increases slowly by 21\% due to widespread deoxygenation and high remineralization. Deoxygenation peaks in two millennia, and the global O2 inventory is reduced by a factor of 2 compared to today. Net denitrification is responsible for 7.8\% of the long-term increase in N2O production. On millennial timescales, marine N2O emissions constitute a small, positive feedback to climate change. Our simulations reveal tight coupling between the marine carbon cycle, O2, N2O, and climate.},

  abstract = {The genus Nitrospira is the most widespread group of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and thrives in diverse natural and engineered ecosystems. Nitrospira marina Nb-295T was isolated from the ocean over 30 years ago; however, its genome has not yet been analyzed. Here, we investigated the metabolic potential of N. marina based on its complete genome sequence and performed physiological experiments to test genome-derived hypotheses. Our data confirm that N. marina benefits from additions of undefined organic carbon substrates, has adaptations to resist oxidative, osmotic, and UV light-induced stress and low dissolved pCO2, and requires exogenous vitamin B12. In addition, N. marina is able to grow chemoorganotrophically on formate, and is thus not an obligate chemolithoautotroph. We further investigated the proteomic response of N. marina to low (∼5.6 µM) O2 concentrations. The abundance of a potentially more efficient CO2-fixing pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (POR) complex and a high-affinity cbb3-type terminal oxidase increased under O2 limitation, suggesting a role in sustaining nitrite oxidation-driven autotrophy. This putatively more O2-sensitive POR complex might be protected from oxidative damage by Cu/Zn-binding superoxide dismutase, which also increased in abundance under low O2 conditions. Furthermore, the upregulation of proteins involved in alternative energy metabolisms, including Group 3b [NiFe] hydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase, indicate a high metabolic versatility to survive conditions unfavorable for aerobic nitrite oxidation. In summary, the genome and proteome of the first marine Nitrospira isolate identifies adaptations to life in the oxic ocean and provides insights into the metabolic diversity and niche differentiation of NOB in marine environments.},

While the website now counts around 1,000 distinct monthly users, its design could not accommodate larger compound databases and it lacked a scalable Application Programming Interface (API) for integration into other tools developed by the systems biology community. Here, we report on the recent updates to the database as well as the addition of a new Python-based interface to eQuilibrator that adds many new features such as a 100-fold larger compound database, the ability to add novel compounds, improvements in speed and memory use, and correction for Mg2+ ion concentrations. Moreover, the new interface can compute the covariance matrix of the uncertainty between estimates, for which we show the advantages and describe the application in metabolic modelling. We foresee that these improvements will make thermodynamic modelling more accessible and facilitate the integration of eQuilibrator into other software platforms.},

In this hadean environment, chemical transformations were driven by fluctuations of the naturally given physical parameters established for example by wet–dry cycles. These conditions might have allowed for the formation of (self)-replicating RNA as the fundamental biopolymer during chemical evolution. The question of how a complex multistep chemical synthesis of RNA building blocks was possible in such an environment remains unanswered. Here we report that geothermal fields could provide the right setup for establishing wet–dry cycles that allow for the synthesis of RNA nucleosides by continuous synthesis. Our model provides both the canonical and many ubiquitous non-canonical purine nucleosides in parallel by simple changes of physical parameters such as temperature, pH and concentration. The data show that modified nucleosides were potentially formed as competitor molecules. They could in this sense be considered as molecular fossils.},

Although many studies have been made with the aim of understanding the genomic contents of early life, uncertainty remains. A study by Weiss et al. (Weiss MC, Sousa FL, Mrnjavac N, Neukirchen S, Roettger M, Nelson-Sathi S, Martin WF. 2016. The physiology and habitat of the last universal common ancestor. Nat Microbiol. 1(9):16116.) identified a number of protein families in the last universal common ancestor of archaea and bacteria (LUCA) which were not found in previous works. Here, we report new research that suggests the clustering approaches used in this previous study undersampled protein families, resulting in incomplete phylogenetic trees which do not reflect protein family evolution. Phylogenetic analysis of protein families which include more sequence homologs rejects a simple LUCA hypothesis based on phylogenetic separation of the bacterial and archaeal domains for a majority of the previously identified LUCA proteins (\$82\%). To supplement limitations of phylogenetic inference derived from incompletely populated orthologous groups and to test the hypothesis of a period of rapid evolution preceding the separation of the domains, we compared phylogenetic distances both within and between domains, for thousands of orthologous groups. We find a substantial diversity of interdomain versus intradomain branch lengths, even among protein families which exhibit a single domain separating branch and are thought to be associated with the LUCA. Additionally, phylogenetic trees with long interdomain branches relative to intradomain branches are enriched in information categories of protein families in comparison to those associated with metabolic functions. These results provide a new view of protein family evolution and temper claims about the phenotype and habitat of the LUCA.},

  abstract = {Summary                            Microbial enzymes often occur as distinct variants that share the same substrate but differ in substrate affinity, sensitivity to environmental conditions, or phylogenetic ancestry. Determining where variants occur in the environment helps identify thresholds that constrain microbial cycling of key chemicals, including the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N               2               O). To understand the enzymatic basis of N               2               O cycling in the ocean, we mined metagenomes to characterize genes encoding bacterial nitrous oxide reductase (NosZ) catalyzing N               2               O reduction to N               2               . We examined data sets from diverse biomes but focused primarily on those from oxygen minimum zones where N               2               O levels are often elevated. With few exceptions, marine               nosZ               data sets were dominated by ‘atypical’ clade II gene variants. Atypical               nosZ               has been associated with low oxygen, enhanced N               2               O affinity, and organisms lacking enzymes for complete denitrification, i.e., non‐denitrifiers. Atypical               nos               Z often occurred in metagenome‐assembled genomes (MAGs) with nitrate or nitrite respiration genes, although MAGs with genes for complete denitrification were rare. We identified atypical               nos               Z in several taxa not previously associated with N               2               O consumption, in addition to known N               2               O‐associated groups. The data suggest that marine environments generally select for high N               2               O‐scavenging ability across diverse taxa and have implications for how N               2               O concentration may affect N               2               O removal rates.},

While macrofaunal diversity and nitrogen retention are greatly affected by changes in sedimentary mud content, its impact on prokaryotic diversity and nitrogen cycling activity remains understudied. We characterized the composition of estuarine tidal flat prokaryotic communities spanning a habitat range from sandy to muddy sediments, while controlling for salinity and distance. We also determined the diversity, abundance and expression of ammonia oxidizers and N               2               O‐reducers within these communities by               amoA               and clade I               nosZ               gene and transcript analysis. Results show that prokaryotic communities and nitrogen cycling fractions were sensitive to changes in sedimentary mud content, and that changes in the overall community were driven by a small number of phyla. Significant changes occurred in prokaryotic communities and N               2               O‐reducing fractions with only a 3\% increase in mud, while thresholds for ammonia oxidizers were less distinct, suggesting other factors are also important for structuring these guilds. Expression of nitrogen cycling genes was substantially higher in muddier sediments, and results indicate that the potential for coupled nitrification–denitrification became increasingly prevalent as mud content increased. Altogether, results demonstrate that mud content is a strong environmental driver of diversity and N‐cycling dynamics in estuarine microbial communities.},

Here we introduce the concept of a metabolic network's “seed set”—the set of compounds that, based on the network topology, are exogenously acquired—and provide a methodological framework to computationally infer the seed set of a given network. Such seed sets form ecological “interfaces” between metabolic networks and their surroundings, approximating the effective biochemical environment of each species. Analyzing the metabolic networks of 478 species and identifying the seed set of each species, we present a comprehensive large-scale reconstruction of such predicted metabolic environments. The seed sets' composition significantly correlates with several basic properties characterizing the species' environments and agrees with biological observations concerning major adaptations. Species whose environments are highly predictable (e.g., obligate parasites) tend to have smaller seed sets than species living in variable environments. Phylogenetic analysis of the seed sets reveals the complex dynamics governing gain and loss of seeds across the phylogenetic tree and the process of transition between seed and non-seed compounds. Our findings suggest that the seed state is transient and that seeds tend either to be dropped completely from the network or to become non-seed compounds relatively fast. The seed sets also permit a successful reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree of life. The “reverse ecology” approach presented lays the foundations for studying the evolutionary interplay between organisms and their habitats on a large scale.},

  abstract = {Summary                            Ammonia‐oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) play a vital role in bridging the input of fixed nitrogen, through N‐fixation and remineralization, to its loss by denitrification and anammox. Yet the major environmental factors determining AOB and AOA population dynamics are little understood, despite both groups having a wide environmental distribution. This study examined the relative abundance of both groups of ammonia‐oxidizing organisms (AOO) and the diversity of AOA across large‐scale gradients in temperature, salinity and substrate concentration and dissolved oxygen. The relative abundance of AOB and AOA varied across environments, with AOB dominating in the freshwater region of the Chesapeake Bay and AOA more abundant in the water column of the coastal and open ocean. The highest abundance of the AOA               amoA               gene was recorded in the oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) of the Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP) and the Arabian Sea (AS). The ratio of AOA{$\quad$}:{$\quad$}AOB varied from 0.7 in the Chesapeake Bay to 1600 in the Sargasso Sea. Relative abundance of both groups strongly correlated with ammonium concentrations. AOA diversity, as determined by phylogenetic analysis of clone library sequences and archetype analysis from a functional gene DNA microarray, detected broad phylogenetic differences across the study sites. However, phylogenetic diversity within physicochemically congruent stations was more similar than would be expected by chance. This suggests that the prevailing geochemistry, rather than localized dispersal, is the major driving factor determining OTU distribution.},

  abstract = {Beneath the waves, oxygen disappears                            As plastic waste pollutes the oceans and fish stocks decline, unseen below the surface another problem grows: deoxygenation. Breitburg               et al.               review the evidence for the downward trajectory of oxygen levels in increasing areas of the open ocean and coastal waters. Rising nutrient loads coupled with climate change—each resulting from human activities—are changing ocean biogeochemistry and increasing oxygen consumption. This results in destabilization of sediments and fundamental shifts in the availability of key nutrients. In the short term, some compensatory effects may result in improvements in local fisheries, such as in cases where stocks are squeezed between the surface and elevated oxygen minimum zones. In the longer term, these conditions are unsustainable and may result in ecosystem collapses, which ultimately will cause societal and economic harm.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaam7240                        ,                             BACKGROUND                                Oxygen concentrations in both the open ocean and coastal waters have been declining since at least the middle of the 20th century. This oxygen loss, or deoxygenation, is one of the most important changes occurring in an ocean increasingly modified by human activities that have raised temperatures, CO                 2                 levels, and nutrient inputs and have altered the abundances and distributions of marine species. Oxygen is fundamental to biological and biogeochemical processes in the ocean. Its decline can cause major changes in ocean productivity, biodiversity, and biogeochemical cycles. Analyses of direct measurements at sites around the world indicate that oxygen-minimum zones in the open ocean have expanded by several million square kilometers and that hundreds of coastal sites now have oxygen concentrations low enough to limit the distribution and abundance of animal populations and alter the cycling of important nutrients.                                                        ADVANCES               In the open ocean, global warming, which is primarily caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions, is considered the primary cause of ongoing deoxygenation. Numerical models project further oxygen declines during the 21st century, even with ambitious emission reductions. Rising global temperatures decrease oxygen solubility in water, increase the rate of oxygen consumption via respiration, and are predicted to reduce the introduction of oxygen from the atmosphere and surface waters into the ocean interior by increasing stratification and weakening ocean overturning circulation.               In estuaries and other coastal systems strongly influenced by their watershed, oxygen declines have been caused by increased loadings of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and organic matter, primarily from agriculture; sewage; and the combustion of fossil fuels. In many regions, further increases in nitrogen discharges to coastal waters are projected as human populations and agricultural production rise. Climate change exacerbates oxygen decline in coastal systems through similar mechanisms as those in the open ocean, as well as by increasing nutrient delivery from watersheds that will experience increased precipitation.                                Expansion of low-oxygen zones can increase production of N                 2                 O, a potent greenhouse gas; reduce eukaryote biodiversity; alter the structure of food webs; and negatively affect food security and livelihoods. Both acidification and increasing temperature are mechanistically linked with the process of deoxygenation and combine with low-oxygen conditions to affect biogeochemical, physiological, and ecological processes. However, an important paradox to consider in predicting large-scale effects of future deoxygenation is that high levels of productivity in nutrient-enriched coastal systems and upwelling areas associated with oxygen-minimum zones also support some of the world’s most prolific fisheries.                                                        OUTLOOK               Major advances have been made toward understanding patterns, drivers, and consequences of ocean deoxygenation, but there is a need to improve predictions at large spatial and temporal scales important to ecosystem services provided by the ocean. Improved numerical models of oceanographic processes that control oxygen depletion and the large-scale influence of altered biogeochemical cycles are needed to better predict the magnitude and spatial patterns of deoxygenation in the open ocean, as well as feedbacks to climate. Developing and verifying the next generation of these models will require increased in situ observations and improved mechanistic understanding on a variety of scales. Models useful for managing nutrient loads can simulate oxygen loss in coastal waters with some skill, but their ability to project future oxygen loss is often hampered by insufficient data and climate model projections on drivers at appropriate temporal and spatial scales. Predicting deoxygenation-induced changes in ecosystem services and human welfare requires scaling effects that are measured on individual organisms to populations, food webs, and fisheries stocks; considering combined effects of deoxygenation and other ocean stressors; and placing an increased research emphasis on developing nations. Reducing the impacts of other stressors may provide some protection to species negatively affected by low-oxygen conditions. Ultimately, though, limiting deoxygenation and its negative effects will necessitate a substantial global decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as reductions in nutrient discharges to coastal waters.                                                   Low and declining oxygen levels in the open ocean and coastal waters affect processes ranging from biogeochemistry to food security.                                        The global map indicates coastal sites where anthropogenic nutrients have exacerbated or caused O                     2                     declines to {$<$}2 mg liter                     −1                     ({$<$}63 μmol liter                     −1                     ) (red dots), as well as ocean oxygen-minimum zones at 300 m of depth (blue shaded regions).

Not only is it essential for the survival of individual animals, but it regulates global cycles of major nutrients and carbon. The oxygen content of the open ocean and coastal waters has been declining for at least the past half-century, largely because of human activities that have increased global temperatures and nutrients discharged to coastal waters. These changes have accelerated consumption of oxygen by microbial respiration, reduced solubility of oxygen in water, and reduced the rate of oxygen resupply from the atmosphere to the ocean interior, with a wide range of biological and ecological consequences. Further research is needed to understand and predict long-term, global- and regional-scale oxygen changes and their effects on marine and estuarine fisheries and ecosystems.},

Software analysis tools can be designed to use human-curated knowledge and expert rules, but more novel artificial intelligence (AI) approaches such as machine learning (ML) are being integrated into clinical microbiology practice. These image analysis AI (IAAI) tools are beginning to penetrate routine clinical microbiology practice, and their scope and impact on routine clinical microbiology practice will continue to grow. This review separates the IAAI applications into 2 broad classification categories: (i) rare event detection/classification or (ii) score-based/categorical classification. Rare event detection can be used for screening purposes or for final identification of a microbe including microscopic detection of mycobacteria in a primary specimen, detection of bacterial colonies growing on nutrient agar, or detection of parasites in a stool preparation or blood smear. Score-based image analysis can be applied to a scoring system that classifies images in toto as its output interpretation and examples include application of the Nugent score for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis and interpretation of urine cultures. The benefits, challenges, development, and implementation strategies of IAAI tools are explored. In conclusion, IAAI is beginning to impact the routine practice of clinical microbiology, and its use can enhance the efficiency and quality of clinical microbiology practice. Although the future of IAAI is promising, currently IAAI only augments human effort and is not a replacement for human expertise.},

A criticism of this model is its reliance on unpredictable rehydration events, like rainstorms. Here, we report the ability of deliquescent minerals to mediate the oligomerization of glycine during iterative wet–dry cycles. The reaction mixtures evaporate to dryness at high temperatures and spontaneously reacquire water vapor to form aqueous solutions at low temperatures. Deliquescent mixtures can foster yields of oligomerization over ten-fold higher than non-deliquescent controls. The deliquescent mixtures tightly regulate their moisture content, which is crucial, as too little water precludes dissolution of the reactants while too much water favors hydrolysis over condensation. The model also suggests a potential reason why life evolved to favor the enrichment of potassium: so living systems could acquire and retain sufficient water to serve as a solvent for biochemical reactions.},

Although we observe                                                                        N                                            O                       2                       −                                                                                       formation under aerobic conditions, its concentration is not stoichiometric with the NH               2               OH concentration. By contrast, under anaerobic conditions, the enzyme uses 4 oxidizing equivalents (eq) to convert 2 eq of NH               2               OH to N               2               O. Enzyme kinetics coupled to UV/visible absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies support a mechanism in which an Fe               III               –NH               2               OH adduct of cyt P460 is oxidized to an \{FeNO\}               6               unit. This species subsequently undergoes nucleophilic attack by a second equivalent of NH               2               OH, forming the N–N bond of N               2               O during a bimolecular, rate-determining step. We propose that                                                                        N                                            O                       2                       −                                                                                       results when nitric oxide (NO) dissociates from the \{FeNO\}               6               intermediate and reacts with dioxygen. Thus,                                                                        N                                            O                       2                       −                                                                                       is not a direct product of cyt P460 activity. We hypothesize that the cyt P460 oxidation of NH               2               OH contributes to NO and N               2               O emissions from nitrifying microorganisms.},

  abstract = {Significance             The enzymatic reactions that occur during nitrification are nature’s means to use ammonia as cellular fuel. Complete understanding of nitrification and related processes are vital to sustainable agriculture and renewable energy technologies. The prevailing view of the first phase of nitrification is that ammonia oxidizing bacteria use two enzymes, ammonia monooxygenase and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, to oxidize ammonia to nitrite via hydroxylamine as an obligate intermediate. Our work reveals nitric oxide as an additional obligate intermediate. The presented findings necessitate revision of a key biogeochemical process, identify a new bioenergetic role for nitric oxide, predict participation of a third enzyme in the biological oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, and will inform models toward sustainable agriculture.           ,                             Ammonia (NH               3               )-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) emit substantial amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N               2               O), both of which contribute to the harmful environmental side effects of large-scale agriculture. The currently accepted model for AOB metabolism involves NH               3               oxidation to nitrite (NO               2               –               ) via a single obligate intermediate, hydroxylamine (NH               2               OH). Within this model, the multiheme enzyme hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) catalyzes the four-electron oxidation of NH               2               OH to NO               2               –               . We provide evidence that HAO oxidizes NH               2               OH by only three electrons to NO under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. NO               2               –               observed in HAO activity assays is a nonenzymatic product resulting from the oxidation of NO by O               2               under aerobic conditions. Our present study implies that aerobic NH               3               oxidation by AOB occurs via two obligate intermediates, NH               2               OH and NO, necessitating a mediator of the third enzymatic step.},

  abstract = {Ion exchange in clays and other minerals is dependent on the crystalline structure of the mineral and on the chemical composition of any solution in contact with the mineral. The structures of clay minerals and zeolites are briefly described to provide a background for the discussion of their ion-exchange reactions. Ion exchange in these minerals is a reversible chemical reaction that takes place between ions held near a mineral surface by unbalanced electrical charges within the mineral framework and ions in a solution in contact with the mineral. Generally the excess charge on the mineral is negative, and it attracts cations from the solution to neutralize this charge. The chemical reactions in ion exchange follow the law of mass action, but the reactions are restricted by the number of exchange sites on the mineral and by the strength of the bonding of the exchangeable cations to the mineral surface. Titration of H-clays with bases shows that montmorillonites and "illites" behave like a mixture of two or three different acids, whereas kaolinite, with an indefinite number of exchange sites, behaves like an indefinite number of acids. Ion-exchange capacity is measured in chemical equivalents of base adsorbed at pH 7. Each clay mineral has a range of exchange capacities because of differences in structure and in chemical composition. The ranges (in milliequivalents per 100grams) are kaolinite, 3-15; halloysite (2H2O), 5-10; halloysite (4H20), 40-50; montmorillonite, 70-100; "illite," 10-40; vermiculite, 100-150; glauconite, 11-20; attapulgite, 20-30; and allophane, 70. The common metallic cations found in exchange positions in clay minerals are Ca42, Mg42, Na+, and K+. At low pH values H+ replaces other cations. The order of replaceability of the common cations has been found to be: Li4 {$<$} Na+ {$<$} K+ {$<$} Rb+ {$<$} Cs4 and Mg42 {$<$} Ca« {$<$} Sr42 {$<$} Ba42. Bivalent cations enter the exchange sites preferentially to univalent cations. The common exchangeable cation in most clay minerals in soils is Ca42. Other exchange phenomena discussed are anion exchange, fixation of cations and anions by clay minerals, effect of environment on cation exchange, and the exchange capacity of zeolites, of rocks, of other minerals, of organic matter and organic complexes, and of amorphous mineral material.},

  abstract = {The genomic core concept has found several uses in comparative and evolutionary genomics. Defined as the set of all genes common to (ubiquitous among) all genomes in a phylogenetically coherent group, core size decreases as the number and phylogenetic diversity of the relevant group increases. Here, we focus on methods for defining the size and composition of the core of all genes shared by sequenced genomes of prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea). There are few (almost certainly less than 50) genes shared by all of the 147 genomes compared, surely insufficient to conduct all essential functions. Sequencing and annotation errors are responsible for the apparent absence of some genes, while very limited but genuine disappearances (from just one or a few genomes) can account for several others. Core size will continue to decrease as more genome sequences appear, unless the requirement for ubiquity is relaxed. Such relaxation seems consistent with any reasonable biological purpose for seeking a core, but it renders the problem of definition more problematic. We propose an alternative approach (the phylogenetically balanced core), which preserves some of the biological utility of the core concept. Cores, however delimited, preferentially contain informational rather than operational genes; we present a new hypothesis for why this might be so.},

  abstract = {Significance                            This paper describes experimental and computational evidence that the hydride shift that converts glyceraldehyde to dihydroxyacetone at basic pH with Ca               2+               catalysis proceeds primarily by quantum tunneling. This answers the last question about the mechanism of the formose reaction, in which formaldehyde is converted to higher sugars under these conditions. This reaction has long been seen as an important clue to the formation of molecules needed for life under prebiotic conditions on Earth. Earlier work showed that the mechanism involved a hydride shift, not a deprotonation, and this work confirms those conclusions. It shows the critical role of tunneling, a quantum effect important in chemistry and biology, and in likely prebiotic reactions on Earth or elsewhere, one concern of astrobiology.                        ,                             Hydrogen atom transfer reactions between the aldose and ketose are key mechanistic features in formose chemistry by which formaldehyde is converted to higher sugars under credible prebiotic conditions. For one of these transformations, we have investigated whether hydrogen tunneling makes a significant contribution to the mechanism by examining the deuterium kinetic isotope effect associated with the hydrogen transfer during the isomerization of glyceraldehyde to the corresponding dihydroxyacetone. To do this, we developed a quantitative HPLC assay that allowed us to measure the apparent large intrinsic kinetic isotope effect. From the Arrhenius plot of the kinetic isotope effect, the ratio of the preexponential factors               A               H               /               A               D               was 0.28 and the difference in activation energies               E               a(D)               −               E               a(H)               was 9.1 kJ·mol               −1               . All these results imply a significant quantum-mechanical tunneling component in the isomerization mechanism. This is supported by multidimensional tunneling calculations using POLYRATE with small curvature tunneling.},

  abstract = {Formaldehyde (HCHO), the simplest aldehyde, is an intermediate oxidation state one carbon molecule that exists transiently but prominently in the abiological carbon cycle, and is ubiquitous in the cosmos. Its potential prebiotic importance is suggested by the fact that it readily undergoes a variety of addition and redox reactions to give products of biological significance including sugars and amino acids. It is especially important with respect to the origin of an RNA or pre-RNA world, since HCHO may be a precursor to ribose and other sugars. HCHO is introduced to the environment by a number of processes including atmospheric and aqueous phase synthesis as well as extraterrestrial delivery, balanced by various destructive processes such as photolysis and redox equilibration in hydrothermal environments. While the Strecker synthesis of amino acids can occur at very low dilution, even best case scenarios for HCHO steady-state concentrations in the primitive oceans are too low for the formation of sugars to occur. Concentration mechanisms would thus be necessary. As HCHO is volatile, direct evaporation is not possible, but other geochemical mechanisms such as eutectic freezing and conversion to non-volatile derivatives by reaction with other species present in the primitive environment, followed by evaporation, could have concentrated HCHO sufficiently to allow for sugar synthesis.},

In the late 1980s, a hypothesis arose that proposed that transition metal sulfides (in particular pyrrhotite and pyrite) might play a significant role promoting abiotic organic chemistry. As an outgrowth of this hypothesis, elaborate theories were presented, including proposals for earliest life being structurally distinct from extant prokaryotic life. During the 1990s and into the twenty-first century, experimental evidence has emerged that supports certain aspects of these theories; in other cases, the experiments reveal chemistry that diverges significantly from that which was proposed theoretically. In either case, however, there is clear evidence that transition metal sulfide minerals exhibit catalytic qualities for the promotion of reactions that have obvious metabolic utility and, therefore, could have provided the primitive Earth with valuable biochemical intermediates.},

  abstract = {Reconstructing ancestral bacteria                            The origin of the eubacteria and phylogenetic relationships between subgroups have been difficult to resolve. Applying a phylogenetic analysis and recent computational methods to the expanded diversity of bacterial sequences from metagenomic analyses, Coleman               et al.               infer the root of the eubacterial tree (see the Perspective by Katz). The root was determined without using the Archaea as an outgroup, to avoid the possibility of a false result due to long branch attraction. This method places the eubacterial root in the neighborhood of Fusobacteriota. Using this information, the authors reconstructed the eubacterial ancestor, identifying that this organism likely had a double-membrane cell envelope, flagellum-mediated motility, antiphage defense mechanisms, and diverse metabolic pathways.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eabe0511               ; see also p.               574                        ,              A phylogenetic analysis models the evolution of 11,272 protein families in bacteria and identifies the likely evolutionary root.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Bacteria are the most diverse and abundant cellular organisms on Earth, and in recent years environmental genomics has revealed the existence of an enormous diversity of previously unknown lineages. Despite the abundance of genomic sequence data, the root of the bacterial tree and the nature of the most recent common ancestor of Bacteria have remained elusive. The problem is that even with the help of new data, tracing billions of years of bacterial evolution back to the root has remained challenging because standard phylogenetic models do not account for the full range of evolutionary processes that shape bacterial genomes. In particular, standard models treat horizontal gene transfer as an impediment to the reconstruction of the tree of life that must be removed from analyses. But if horizontal gene transfer is modeled appropriately, it can provide information about the deep past that is unavailable to standard methods.                                         RATIONALE               We reconstructed and rooted the bacterial tree by applying a hierarchical phylogenomic approach that explicitly uses information from gene duplications and losses within a genome as well as gene transfers between genomes. This approach allowed us to root the tree without including an archaeal outgroup. Outgroup-free rooting is a promising approach for Bacteria, both because the position of the universal root is uncertain and because the long branch separating Bacteria from Archaea has the potential to distort the reconstruction of within-Bacteria relationships. Outgroup-free gene tree-species tree reconciliation allowed us to quantitatively model both the vertical and horizontal components of bacterial evolution and integrate information from 11,272 gene families to resolve the root of the bacterial tree. Notably, these analyses also provided estimates of the gene content of the last bacterial common ancestor.                                         RESULTS               Our analyses place the root between two major bacterial clades, the Gracilicutes and Terrabacteria. We found no support for a root between the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR), a lineage comprising putative symbionts and parasites with small genomes, and all other Bacteria. Instead, the CPR was inferred to be a member of the Terrabacteria and formed a sister lineage to the Chloroflexota and Dormibacterota. This suggests that the CPR evolved by reductive genome evolution from free-living ancestors. Gene families inferred to have been present at the root indicate that the last bacterial common ancestor was already a complex double-membraned cell capable of motility and chemotaxis that possessed a CRISPR-Cas system. Although \textasciitilde 92\% of gene families have experienced horizontal transfers during their history, tracing their evolution along the most likely rooted tree revealed that about two-thirds of gene transmissions have been vertical. Thus, bacterial evolution has a major vertical component, despite a profound impact of horizontal gene transfer through time. Horizontal gene flows can also provide insight into the temporal sequence of events during bacterial diversification, because donor lineages must be at least as old as recipients. Analysis of gene transfers in our dataset suggests that the diversification of the Firmicutes, CPR, Acidobacteriota, and Proteobacteria is the oldest among extant bacterial phyla.                                         CONCLUSION               The vertical and horizontal components of genome evolution provide complementary sources of information about bacterial phylogeny. The vertical component provides a robust framework for interpreting species diversity and allows us to reconstruct ancestral states, while the horizontal component helps to root the vertical tree and orient it in time. The inferred Gracilicutes-Terrabacteria root will be useful for investigating the tempo and mode of bacterial diversification, metabolic innovation, and changes in cell architecture such as the evolutionary transitions between double (diderm) and single (monoderm) membranes. Future development of methods that harness the complementarity of vertical and horizontal gene transmission will continue to further our understanding of life on Earth.                                                   A rooted phylogeny of Bacteria.                   The reconciliation of bacterial gene phylogenies places the root between the major clades of Gracilicutes (including Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota) and Terrabacteria (including Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria). On the basis of this hypothesis, ancestral genome reconstruction predicts that the last bacterial common ancestor (LBCA) was a complex, double-membraned cell and that, on average, two-thirds of gene transmissions have been vertically inherited along this rooted tree.                                                                         ,              A rooted bacterial tree is necessary to understand early evolution, but the position of the root is contested. Here, we model the evolution of 11,272 gene families to identify the root, extent of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and the nature of the last bacterial common ancestor (LBCA). Our analyses root the tree between the major clades Terrabacteria and Gracilicutes and suggest that LBCA was a free-living flagellated, rod-shaped double-membraned organism. Contrary to recent proposals, our analyses reject a basal placement of the Candidate Phyla Radiation, which instead branches sister to Chloroflexota within Terrabacteria. While most gene families (92\%) have evidence of HGT, overall, two-thirds of gene transmissions have been vertical, suggesting that a rooted tree provides a meaningful frame of reference for interpreting bacterial evolution.},

A number of studies have done so, all using a unique set of methods and bioinformatics databases. Here, we compare predictions across eight such studies and measure both their agreement with one another and with the consensus predictions among them. We find that some LUCA genome studies show a strong agreement with the consensus predictions of the others, but that no individual study shares a high or even moderate degree of similarity with any other individual study. From these observations, we conclude that the consensus among studies provides a more accurate depiction of the core proteome of the LUCA and its functional repertoire. The set of consensus LUCA protein family predictions between all of these studies portrays a LUCA genome that, at minimum, encoded functions related to protein synthesis, amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and the use of common, nucleotide-­derived organic cofactors.},

Mineral surfaces have the potential to facilitate prebiotic polymerization due to their ability to adsorb and concentrate biomolecules that subsequently can catalyse reactions; however, the precise nature of the interaction between the mineral host and the guest biomolecule still needs to be understood. In this context, we spectroscopically characterized, using infrared, X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques, the interaction between L-proline and montmorillonite, olivine, iron disulphide, and haematite (minerals of prebiotic interest), by evaluating their interaction from a liquid medium. This work provides insight into the chemical processes occurring between proline, the only cyclic amino acid, and this selection of minerals, each of them bearing a particular chemical and crystal structures. Proline was successfully adsorbed on montmorillonite, haematite, olivine, and iron disulphide in anionic and zwitterionic chemical forms, being the predominant form directly related to the mineral structure and composition. Silicates (montmorillonite) dominate adsorption, whereas iron oxides (haematite) show the lowest molecular affinity. This approach will help to understand structure-affinity relationship between the mineral surfaces and proline, one of the nine amino acids generated in the Miller-Urey experiment.},

However, it is generally assumed that the environments in which life appeared were hydrothermal environments, with highly variable conditions in terms of pH, temperature or redox levels. Are evolutionary processes favored to appear in such settings, where the target of biological adaptation changes over time? How would the first evolving populations compete with non-evolving populations? Using a numerical model, we explore the effect of environmental variation on the outcome of the competition between evolving and non-evolving populations of protocells. Our study found that, while evolving protocells consistently outcompete non-evolving populations in stable environments, they are outcompeted in variable environments when environmental variations occur on a timescale similar to the average duration of a generation. This is due to the energetic burden represented by adaptation to the wrong environmental conditions. Since the timescale of temperature variation in natural hydrothermal settings overlaps with the average prokaryote generation time, the current work indicates that a solution must have been found by early life to overcome this threshold.},

  abstract = {The seminal Urey−Miller experiments showed that molecules crucial to life such as HCN could have formed in the reducing atmosphere of the Hadean Earth and then dissolved in the oceans. Subsequent proponents of the “RNA World” hypothesis have shown aqueous HCN to be the starting point for the formation of the precursors of RNA and proteins. However, the conditions of early Earth suggest that aqueous HCN would have had to react under a significant number of constraints. Therefore, given the limiting conditions, could RNA and protein precursors still have formed from aqueous HCN? If so, what mechanistic routes would have been followed? The current computational study, with the aid of the ab initio nanoreactor (AINR), a powerful new tool in computational chemistry, addresses these crucial questions. Gratifyingly, not only do the results from the AINR approach show that aqueous HCN could indeed have been the source of RNA and protein precursors, but they also indicate that just the interaction of HCN with water would have sufficed to begin a series of reactions leading to the precursors. The current work therefore provides important missing links in the story of prebiotic chemistry and charts the road from aqueous HCN to the precursors of RNA and proteins.},

The idea of a “primordial soup” has been subject to extensive criticism from thermodynamic, biochemical and geochemical perspectives, yet recent advancements have made clearer the plausibility of this theory. Herein, we review the theoretical and experimental approaches which have previously been explored, among these modelling, laboratory‐confined and geologically motivated experimentation. Of these, we consider organo‐mineral interactions, uniting aspects of prebiotic chemistry and geology, to be an especially promising way forward. However, we aim here to advance current approaches by advocating a methodology involving chemical systems and their stochastic reactivity on heterogeneous geological surfaces. This models the origins of life as a continuity of chemical reactions in an analogue to the early Earth (Hadean) environment.},

Some parts of the puzzle seem to appear with a rather high degree of clarity, while others remain totally obscure. We cannot be sure that life emerged only on our Earth, but we believe that the presence of large amounts of water in its liquid state is absolutely essential for the emergence and evolution of living matter. We can also assume that the latter exploits everywhere the same light elements, mainly C, H, O, N, S, and P, and somehow manipulates the same simple monomeric and polymeric organic compounds, such as alpha-amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic bases, and surface-active carboxylic acids. The author contributes to the field by stating that all fundamental particles of our matter are “homochiral” and predominantly produce in an absolute asymmetric synthesis amino acids of L-configuration and carbohydrates of Dseries. Another important point is that free atmospheric oxygen mainly stems from the photolysis of water molecules by cosmic irradiation and is not necessarily bound to living organisms on the planet.},

  abstract = {During the last century a number of authors pointed to the inherently systemic and dynamic nature of the living, yet their message was largely ignored by the mainstream of the scientific community. Tibor Ganti was one of those early pioneers, proposing a theoretical framework to understand the living principles in terms of chemical transformation cycles and their coupling. The turn of the century then brought with it a novel ‘systems’ paradigm, which shined light on all that previous work and carried many implications for the way we conceive of chemical and biological complexity today. In this article tribute is paid to some of those seminal contributions, highlighting the importance of adopting a systems view in present chemistry, particularly if plausible mechanisms of chemical evolution toward the first living entities want to be unraveled. We examine and put in perspective recent discoveries in the emerging subfield of ‘prebiotic systems chemistry’, reaching the conclusion that the functional coupling of protocellular subsystems (i.e., protometabolism, protogenome and membrane compartment) is the most challenging target to make qualitative advances in the problem of the origins of life. For the longawaited goal of assembling an autonomous protocell from its most basic molecular building blocks, we further suggest that a systems integrative strategy should be considered from the earliest synthetic steps, already at the level of monomer precursors, opening the way to biogenesis.},

Our theory shows that the overall reaction associated with the network is aligned with the thermodynamic force that drives the system out of equilibrium. We also demonstrate that the thermodynamic force required to operate at a maximal flux obeys universal constraints that are independent of the kinetics, but solely determined by the stoichiometry of the overall process and by the structural properties of the underlying chemical reaction network.},

The rates varied between 0.5 µmol N m−2 h−1 in sands and 28.7 µmol N m−2 h−1 in muddy sediments and showed a good correlation to the organic carbon contents of the surface sediments. N-removal rates via sedimentary denitrification were estimated for the entire Baltic Sea calculating sediment specific denitrification rates and interpolating them to the whole Baltic Sea area. Another approach was carried out by using the relationship between the organic carbon content and the rate of denitrification. The N-removal by denitrification in sediments varied between 426–652 kt N a−1, which is around 48–73\% of the external N inputs delivered via rivers, coastal point sources, and atmospheric deposition. Moreover, an expansion of the anoxic bottom areas was considered under the assumption of a rising oxycline from 100 to 80 m water depth. This leads to an increase of the area with anoxic conditions and an overall decrease in sedimentary denitrification by 14\%. Overall, we show here that this type of data extrapolation is a powerful tool to estimate the nitrogen losses for a whole coastal sea and may be applicable to other coastal regions and enclosed seas.},

However, other members of the Planctomycetes–Verrucomicrobia–Chlamydiae superphylum are primarily free living. How Chlamydiae transitioned to an endosymbiotic lifestyle is still largely unresolved. Here we reconstructed Planctomycetes–Verrucomicrobia–Chlamydiae species relationships and modelled superphylum genome evolution. Gene content reconstruction from 11,996\,gene families suggests a motile and facultatively anaerobic last common Chlamydiae ancestor that had already gained characteristic endosymbiont genes. Counter to expectations for genome streamlining in strict endosymbionts, we detected substantial gene gain within Chlamydiae. We found that divergence in energy metabolism and aerobiosis observed in extant lineages emerged later during chlamydial evolution. In particular, metabolic and aerobic genes characteristic of the more metabolically versatile protist-infecting chlamydiae were gained, such as respiratory chain complexes. Our results show that metabolic complexity can increase during endosymbiont evolution, adding an additional perspective for understanding symbiont evolutionary trajectories across the tree of life.},

However, this picture changed with the discovery of a large diversity of archaea in non-extreme environments enabled by the use of cultivation-independent methods. These approaches have allowed the reconstruction of genomes of uncultivated microorganisms and revealed that archaea are diverse and broadly distributed in the biosphere and seemingly include a large diversity of putative symbiotic organisms, most of which belong to the tentative archaeal superphylum referred to as DPANN. This archaeal group encompasses at least 10 different lineages and includes organisms with extremely small cell and genome sizes and limited metabolic capabilities. Therefore, many members of DPANN may be obligately dependent on symbiotic interactions with other organisms and may even include novel parasites. In this contribution, we review the current knowledge of the gene repertoires and lifestyles of members of this group and discuss their placement in the tree of life, which is the basis for our understanding of the deep microbial roots and the role of symbiosis in the evolution of life on Earth.},

Much of the controversy arises from differing views on the defining characteristics of eukaryotes. We argue that eukaryotes should be defined phylogenetically, and that doing so clarifies where competing hypotheses of eukaryogenesis agree and how we may test among aspects of disagreement. Some hypotheses make predictions about the phylogenetic origins of eukaryotic genes and are distinguishable on that basis. However, other hypotheses differ only in the order of key evolutionary steps, like mitochondrial endosymbiosis and nuclear assembly, which cannot currently be distinguished phylogenetically. Stages within eukaryogenesis may be made identifiable through the absolute dating of gene duplicates that map to eukaryotic traits, such as in genes of host or mitochondrial origin that duplicated and diverged functionally prior to emergence of the last eukaryotic common ancestor. In this way, it may finally be possible to distinguish heat from light in the debate over eukaryogenesis.},

  abstract = {Living systems are characterised by an ability to sustain chemical reaction networks far-from-equilibrium. It is likely that life first arose through a process of continual disruption of equilibrium states in recursive reaction networks, driven by periodic environmental changes. Herein, we report the emergence of proto-enzymatic function from recursive polymerisation reactions using amino acids and glycolic acid. Reactions were kept out of equilibrium by diluting products 9:1 in fresh starting solution at the end of each recursive cycle, and the development of complex high molecular weight species is explored using a new metric, the Mass Index, which allows the complexity of the system to be explored as a function of cycle. This process was carried out on a range of different mineral environments. We explored the hypothesis that disrupting equilibrium via recursive cycling imposes a selection pressure and subsequent boundary conditions on products. After just four reaction cycles, product mixtures from recursive reactions exhibit greater catalytic activity and truncation of product space towards higher-molecular-weight species compared to non-recursive controls.},

However, the impact of the temporal dynamics of environmental conditions upon prebiotic chemical reaction networks (CRNs) has not been investigated. Here, we demonstrate how the magnitude and rate of temporal fluctuations of the catalysts Ca2+ and OH–control product distributions of the formose reaction. Surprisingly, the product compositions of the formose reaction under dynamic conditions deviate significantly from those under steady state conditions. We attribute these compositional changes to the non-uniform propagation of fluctuations through the network thereby shaping reaction outcomes. Examination of temporal concentration patterns showed that collections of compounds responded collectively to perturbations, indicating key ‘gating’ reactions branching from the Breslow cycle may be important responsive features of the formose reaction. Our findings show how the compositions of prebiotic reaction networks were shaped by sequential environmental events, illustrating the necessity for considering the temporal traits of prebiotic environments that supported the origin of life.},

This paper considers the alternative possibility: that the antecedents of life were already actively regulating their environment to maintain the conditions necessary for their own persistence. In support of this proposal, we describe ‘viabilitybased behaviour’: a way that simple entities can adaptively regulate their environment in response to their health, and in so doing, increase the likelihood of their survival. Drawing on empirical investigations of simple self-preserving abiological systems, we argue that these viability-based behaviours are simple enough to precede neo-Darwinian evolution. We also explain how their operation can reduce the demanding requirements that mainstream theories place upon the environment(s) in which life emerged.},

  abstract = {Woese and Fox’s 1977 paper on the discovery of the Archaea triggered a revolution in the field of evolutionary biology by showing that life was divided into not only prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Rather, they revealed that prokaryotes comprise two distinct types of organisms, the Bacteria and the Archaea. In subsequent years, molecular phylogenetic analyses indicated that eukaryotes and the Archaea represent sister groups in the tree of life. During the genomic era, it became evident that eukaryotic cells possess a mixture of archaeal and bacterial features in addition to eukaryotic-specific features. Although it has been generally accepted for some time that mitochondria descend from endosymbiotic alphaproteobacteria, the precise evolutionary relationship between eukaryotes and archaea has continued to be a subject of debate. In this Review, we outline a brief history of the changing shape of the tree of life and examine how the recent discovery of a myriad of diverse archaeal lineages has changed our understanding of the evolutionary relationships between the three domains of life and the origin of eukaryotes. Furthermore, we revisit central questions regarding the process of eukaryogenesis and discuss what can currently be inferred about the evolutionary transition from the first to the last eukaryotic common ancestor.},

However, the nature and phylogenetic identity of the last common ancestor of Asgard archaea and eukaryotes remain unresolved               2–4               . Here we analyse distinct phylogenetic marker datasets of an expanded genomic sampling of Asgard archaea and evaluate competing evolutionary scenarios using state-of-the-art phylogenomic approaches. We find that eukaryotes are placed, with high confidence, as a well-nested clade within Asgard archaea and as a sister lineage to Hodarchaeales, a newly proposed order within Heimdallarchaeia. Using sophisticated gene tree and species tree reconciliation approaches, we show that analogous to the evolution of eukaryotic genomes, genome evolution in Asgard archaea involved significantly more gene duplication and fewer gene loss events compared with other archaea. Finally, we infer that the last common ancestor of Asgard archaea was probably a thermophilic chemolithotroph and that the lineage from which eukaryotes evolved adapted to mesophilic conditions and acquired the genetic potential to support a heterotrophic lifestyle. Our work provides key insights into the prokaryote-to-eukaryote transition and a platform for better understanding~the emergence of cellular complexity in eukaryotic cells.},

We show that STRIDE correctly identifies the root of the species tree in multiple largescale molecular phylogenetic data sets spanning a wide range of timescales and taxonomic groups. We demonstrate that the novel probability model implemented in STRIDE can accurately represent the ambiguity in species tree root assignment for data sets where information is limited.

However, species tree inference from molecular sequence data is complicated by gene duplication events that limit the availably of suitable data for phylogenetic reconstruction. Here we propose a novel method for species tree inference called STAG that is specifically designed to leverage data from multi-copy gene families. By application to 12 real species datasets sampled from across the eukaryotic domain we demonstrate that species trees inferred from multi-copy gene families are comparable in accuracy to species trees inferred from single-copy orthologues. We further show that the ability to utilise data from multi-copy gene families increases the amount of data available for species tree inference by an average of 8 fold. We reveal that on real species datasets STAG has higher accuracy than other leading methods for species tree inference; including concatenated alignments of protein sequences, ASTRAL \& NJst. Finally we show that STAG is fast, memory efficient and scalable and thus suitable for analysis of large multispecies datasets.},

Many thresholds for human and ecosystem health have been exceeded owing to N               r               pollution, including those for drinking water (nitrates), air quality (smog, particulate matter, ground-level ozone), freshwater eutrophication, biodiversity loss, stratospheric ozone depletion, climate change and coastal ecosystems (dead zones). Each of these environmental effects can be magnified by the ‘nitrogen cascade’: a single atom of N               r               can trigger a cascade of negative environmental impacts in sequence. Here, we provide an overview of the impact of N               r               on the environment and human health, including an assessment of the magnitude of different environmental problems, and the relative importance of N               r               as a contributor to each problem. In some cases, N               r               loss to the environment is the key driver of effects (e.g. terrestrial and coastal eutrophication, nitrous oxide emissions), whereas in some other situations nitrogen represents a key contributor exacerbating a wider problem (e.g. freshwater pollution, biodiversity loss). In this way, the central role of nitrogen can remain hidden, even though it actually underpins many trans-boundary pollution problems.},

  abstract = {Na-montmorillonite prepared from Volclay by the titration method facilitates the selfcondensation of ImpA, the 5 -phosphorimidazolide derivative of adenosine. As was shown by AE-HPLC analysis and selective enzymatic hydrolysis of products, oligo(A)s formed in this reaction are 10 monomer units long and contain 67\% 3 ,5 -phosphodiester bonds (Ferris and Ertem, 1992a). Under the same reaction conditions, 5 -phosphorimidazolide derivatives of cytidine, uridine and guanosine also undergo self-condensation producing oligomers containing up to 12–14 monomer units for oligo(C)s to 6 monomer units for oligo(G)s. In oligo(C)s and oligo(U)s, 75–80\% of the monomers are linked by 2 ,5 -phosphodiester bonds. Hexamer and higher oligomers isolated from synthetic oligo(C)s formed by montmorillonite catalysis, which contain both 3 ,5 and 2 ,5 -linkages, serve as catalysts for the non-enzymatic template directed synthesis of oligo(G)s from activated monomer 2-MeImpG, guanosine 5 -phospho-2-methylimidazolide (Ertem and Ferris, 1996). Pentamer and higher oligomers containing exclusively 2 ,5 -linkages, which were isolated from the synthetic oligo(C)s, also serve as templates and produce oligo(G)s with both 2 ,5 - and 3 ,5 -phosphodiester bonds. Kinetic studies on montmorillonite catalyzed elongation rates of oligomers using the computer program SIMFIT demonstrated that the rate constants for the formation of oligo(A)s increased in the order of 2-mer {$<$}3-mer {$<$}4-mer . . . {$<$}7-mer (Kawamura and Ferris, 1994). A decameric primer, dA(pdA)8pA bound to montmorillonite was elongated to contain up to 50 monomer units by daily addition of activated monomer ImpA to the reaction mixture (Ferris, Hill and Orgel, 1996). Analysis of dimer fractions formed in the montmorillonite catalyzed reaction of binary and quaternary mixtures of ImpA, ImpC, 2-MeImpG and ImpU suggested that only a limited number of oligomers could have formed on the primitive Earth rather than equal amounts of all possible isomers (Ertem and Ferris, 2000). Formation of phosphodiester bonds between mononucleotides by montmorillonite catalysis is a fascinating discovery, and a significant step forward in efforts to find out how the first RNA-like oligomers might have formed in the course of chemical evolution. However, as has been pointed out in several publications, these systems should be regarded as models rather than a literal representation of prebiotic chemistry (Orgel, 1998; Joyce and Orgel, 1999; Schwartz, 1999).},

  abstract = {This work is an extension of our previous studies carried out to investigate the possible catalytic role of minerals in the abiotic synthesis of biologically important molecules. In the presence of montmorillonite, a member of the phyllosilicate group minerals that are abundant on Earth and identified on Mars, activated RNA monomers, namely 5k-phosphorimidazolides of nucleosides (ImpNs), undergo condensation reactions in aqueous electrolyte solution producing oligomers with similar structures to short RNA fragments. Analysis of the linear trimer isomers formed in the reaction of a mixture of activated adenosine and cytidine monomers (ImpA and ImpC, respectively) employing high-performance liquid chromatography, selective enzymatic hydrolysis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy molecular weight measurements demonstrate that montmorillonite catalysis facilitates the formation of hetero-isomers containing 56 \% A- and 44 \% C-monomer incorporated in their structure. The results also show that 56 \% of the monomer units are linked together by RNA-like 3k,5k-phosphodiester bonds. These results follow the same trend observed in our most recent work studying the reaction of activated adenosine and uridine monomers, and support Bernal’s hypothesis proposing the possible catalytic role of minerals in the abiotic processes in the course of chemical evolution.

  abstract = {One of the shallowest, most intense oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) is found in the eastern tropical South Pacific, off northern Chile and southern Peru. It has a strong oxygen gradient (upper oxycline) and high N2O accumulation. N2O cycling by heterotrophic denitrification along the upper oxycline was studied by measuring N2O production and consumption rates using an improved acetylene blockage method. Dissolved N2O and its isotope (15N : 14N ratio in N2O or d15N) and isotopomer composition (intramolecular distribution of 15N in the N2O or d15Na and d15Nb), dissolved O2, nutrients, and other oceanographic variables were also measured. Strong N2O accumulation (up to 86 nmol L21) was observed in the upper oxycline followed by a decline (around 8–12 nmol L21) toward the OMZ core. N2O production rates by denitrification (NO\{ 2 reduction to N2O) were 2.25 to 50.0 nmol L21 d21, whereas N2O consumption rates (N2O reduction to N2) were 2.73 and 70.8 nmol L21 d21. d15N in N2O increased from 8.57\% in the middle oxycline (50-m depth) to 14.87\% toward the OMZ core (100-m depth), indicating the progressive use of N2O as an electron acceptor by denitrifying organisms. Isotopomer signals of N2O (d15Na and d15Nb) showed an abrupt change at the middle oxycline, indicating different mechanisms of N2O production and consumption in this layer. Thus, partial denitrification along with aerobic ammonium oxidation appears to be responsible for N2O accumulation in the upper oxycline, where O2 levels fluctuate widely; N2O reduction, on the other hand, is an important pathway for N2 production. As a result, the proportion of N2O consumption relative to its production increased as O2 decreased toward the OMZ core. A N2O mass balance in the subsurface layer indicates that only a small amount of the gas could be effluxed into the atmosphere (12.7–30.7 mmol m22 d21) and that most N2O is used as an electron acceptor during denitrification (107–468 mmol m22 d21).\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {Microbial activity measurements and molecular approaches were combined to study temporal variation in nitrogen (N) removal mechanisms from muddy and sandy intertidal sediments (Arcachon Bay, France). Stable isotopes (15NH4þ/15NO3- ) were used to measure oxidation of NH4þ to NO3À/NO2- and its subsequent reduction to N2 via denitrification and/or anammox. We found that denitrification mainly fuelled N loss in both sediment types. However in sandy sediments, anammox accounted for relatively higher N2 production (45\%). Nitrificationedenitrification (Dn) and nitrificationeanammox coupling was observed particularly in muddy sediments. Temporal variations in prokaryotic abundance (Bacteria, Archaea) and of functional groups responsible for nitrification and denitrification were studied by qPCR and for anammoxifiers by cloning. Bacterial density in both sediment types varied between 107À8 equivalent cell per gÀ1 dry weight sediment and were overall more abundant in muddy sediments. Archaeal equivalent cell varied between 0.5 and 6.5\% of the total prokaryotes, with extreme values observed in muddy sediment during October and January respectively. Denitrifiers were 1e2 orders higher than ammonium oxidizers and archeal nitrifiers appeared insignificant compared to betaproteobacterial counterpart. Furthermore, nitrifiers exhibited greater fluctuations in sandy sediments compared to muddy ones. Anammoxifiers were mainly restricted to the “Candidatus Scalindua” group, and were detected in both sediment types and all sampling periods providing an indirect proof on the occurrence of anammox. In muddy sediments, N2 production presented overall higher rate over sandy sediments and exhibited the same trend as nitrifier abundance. This finding suggests a central role of bacterially-mediated benthic nitrification in supporting dissimilatory processes through generation of NO3À/NO2 and preventing eutrophication in this mesotidal lagoon.},

  abstract = {We propose that chemical evolution can take place by natural selection if a geophysical process is capable of heterotrophic formation of liposomes that grow at some base rate, divide by external agitation, and are subject to stochastic chemical avalanches, in the absence of nucleotides or any monomers capable of modular heredity. We model this process using a simple hill-climbing algorithm, and an artificial chemistry that is unique in exhibiting conservation of mass and energy in an open thermodynamic system. Selection at the liposome level results in the stabilization of rarely occurring molecular autocatalysts that either catalyse or are consumed in reactions that confer liposome level fitness; typically they contribute in parallel to an increasingly conserved intermediary metabolism. Loss of competing autocatalysts can sometimes be adaptive. Steady-state energy flux by the individual increases due to the energetic demands of growth, but also of memory, i.e. maintaining variations in the chemical network. Self-organizing principles such as those proposed by Kauffman, Fontana, and Morowitz have been hypothesized as an ordering principle in chemical evolution, rather than chemical evolution by natural selection. We reject those notions as either logically flawed or at best insufficient in the absence of natural selection. Finally, a finite population model without elitism shows the practical evolutionary constraints for achieving chemical evolution by natural selection in the lab.},

Approaches based on satellite indices of absorbed solar radiation indicate marked heterogeneity in NPP for both land and oceans, reflecting the influence of physical and ecological processes. The spatial and temporal distributions of ocean NPP are consistent with primary limitation by light, nutrients, and temperature. On land, water limitation imposes additional constraints. On land and ocean, progressive changes in NPP can result in altered carbon storage, although contrasts in mechanisms of carbon storage and rates of organic matter turnover result in a range of relations between carbon storage and changes in NPP.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Due to competition with modern life forms, no primitive living systems now remain to teach us about how early protocells may have functioned. This selection, however, does not apply to abiotic prebiont systems that formed by natural processes and did not require genetic inheritance to function. Yet very few such system examples are available for research. Decorated vesicles from deep seafloor basalts show four potentially life-analogous features and are interesting prebiotic-system candidates for origin-of-life research. These properties are: a physical enclosure, carbon-assimilatory catalysis, semi-permeable boundaries, and a source of usable energy. Nanometer to micron-sized spherules on the inner walls of decorated vesicles are proposed to function as mineral proto-enzymes. Chemically, these structures resemble synthetic FeS clusters shown to convert CO             2             , CO and H             2             into small organics. Secondary phyllosilicates line the vesicles’ inner walls and fill openings. Clays can act as molecular sieves between the vesicles’ interior and the surrounding aquifer. Lastly, basalt glass in the vesicle walls uptakes protons, which replace cations in the silicate framework. This will result in an inward proton flux, reciprocal outward flux of metal cations, more alkaline pH inside than outside, and production of more phyllosilicates. Such life-supporting features could have been exploited later to assist the origin of chemical networks toward protolife systems. Decorated vesicles are proposed as study models of prebiotic systems and expected to have existed on the early Earth as well. Their analysis can lead to better understanding of changes in planetary geocycles during the origin of life.},

  abstract = {Life requires energy to exist, to reproduce and to survive. Two major hypotheses have been put forward con­ cerning the source of this energy at the very early stages of life evolution: (i) abiotic organics either brought to Earth by comets and/or meteorites, or produced at its atmosphere, and (ii) mineral surface-dependent bio­ inorganic catalytic reactions. Considering the latter possibility, I propose that, besides being a precursor of nucleic acids, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which probably was used very early to improve the fidelity of nucleic acid polymerization, played an essential role in the transition between mineral-bound protocells and their free counterparts. Indeed, phosphorylation by ATP renders carboxylate groups electrophilic enough to react with nucleophiles such as amines, an effect that, thanks to their Lewis acid character, also have dehydrated metal ions on mineral surfaces. Early ATP synthesis for metabolic processes most likely depended on substrate level phosphorylation. However, the exaptation of a hexameric helicase-like ATPase and a transmembrane H+ pump (which evolved to counteract the acidity caused by fermentation reactions within the protocell) generated a much more efficient membrane-bound ATP synthase that uses chemiosmosis to make ATP.},

  abstract = {Biologists used to draw schematic “universal” trees of life as metaphors illustrating the history of life. It is indeed a priori possible to construct an organismal tree connecting the three major domains of ribosome encoding organisms: Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya, since they originated by cell division from LUCA. Several universal trees based on ribosomal RNA sequence comparisons proposed at the end of the last century are still widely used, although some of their main features have been challenged by subsequent analyses. Several authors have proposed to replace the traditional universal tree with a ring of life, whereas others have proposed more recently to include viruses as new domains. These proposals are misleading, suggesting that endosymbiosis can modify the shape of a tree or that viruses originated from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). I propose here an updated version of Woese’s universal tree that includes several rootings for each domain and internal branching within domains that are supported by recent phylogenomic analyses of domain specific proteins. The tree is rooted between Bacteria and Arkarya, a new name proposed for the clade grouping Archaea and Eukarya. A consensus version, in which each of the three domains is unrooted, and a version in which eukaryotes emerged within archaea are also presented. This last scenario assumes the transformation of a modern domain into another, a controversial evolutionary pathway. Viruses are not indicated in these trees but are intrinsically present because they infect the tree from its roots to its leaves. Finally, I present a detailed tree of the domain Archaea, proposing the sub-phylum neo-Euryarchaeota for the monophyletic group of euryarchaeota containing DNA gyrase. These trees, that will be easily updated as new data become available, could be useful to discuss controversial scenarios regarding early life evolution.},

Emissions, mainly of ammonia (NH               3               ) from land together with combustion related emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO                                x                              ), contribute 100 Tg N yr               −1               to the atmosphere, which are transported between countries and processed within the atmosphere, generating secondary pollutants, including ozone and other photochemical oxidants and aerosols, especially ammonium nitrate (NH               4               NO               3               ) and ammonium sulfate (NH               4               )               2               SO               4               . Leaching and riverine transport of NO               3               contribute 40–70 Tg N yr               −1               to coastal waters and the open ocean, which together with the 30 Tg input to oceans from atmospheric deposition combine with marine biological nitrogen fixation (140 Tg N yr               −1               ) to double the ocean processing of N               r               . Some of the marine N               r               is buried in sediments, the remainder being denitrified back to the atmosphere as N               2               or N               2               O. The marine processing is of a similar magnitude to that in terrestrial soils and vegetation, but has a larger fraction of natural origin. The lifetime of N               r               in the atmosphere, with the exception of N               2               O, is only a few weeks, while in terrestrial ecosystems, with the exception of peatlands (where it can be 10               2               –10               3               years), the lifetime is a few decades. In the ocean, the lifetime of N               r               is less well known but seems to be longer than in terrestrial ecosystems and may represent an important long-term source of N               2               O that will respond very slowly to control measures on the sources of N               r               from which it is produced.},

  abstract = {Ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms are an important source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) in aquatic environments. Identifying the impact of pH on N2O production by ammonia oxidizers is key to understanding how aquatic greenhouse gas fluxes will respond to naturally occurring pH changes, as well as acidification driven by anthropogenic CO2. We assessed N2O production rates and formation mechanisms by communities of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) in a lake and a marine environment, using incubation-based nitrogen (N) stable isotope tracer methods with 15N-labeled ammonium (15NH+4 ) and nitrite (15NO−2 ), and also measurements of the natural abundance N and O isotopic composition of dissolved N2O. N2O production during incubations of water from the shallow hypolimnion of Lake Lugano (Switzerland) was significantly higher when the pH was reduced from 7.54 (untreated pH) to 7.20 (reduced pH), while ammonia oxidation rates were similar between treatments. In all incubations, added NH+4 was the source of most of the N incorporated into N2O, suggesting that the main N2O production pathway involved hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and/or NO−2 produced by ammonia oxidation during the incubation period. A small but significant amount of N derived from exogenous/added 15NO−2 was also incorporated into N2O, but only during the reduced-pH incubations. Mass spectra of this N2O revealed that NH+4 and 15NO−2 each contributed N equally to N2O by a “hybrid-N2O” mechanism consistent with a reaction between NH2OH and NO−2 , or compounds derived from these two molecules. Nitrifier denitrification was not an important source of N2O. Isotopomeric N2O analyses in Lake Lugano were consistent with incubation results, as 15N enrichment of the internal N vs. external N atoms produced site preferences (25.0–34.4 ) consistent with NH2OH-dependent hybrid-N2O production. Hybrid-N2O formation was also observed during incubations of seawater from coastal Namibia with 15NH+4 and NO−2 . However, the site preference of dissolved N2O here was low (4.9 ), indicating that another mechanism, not captured during the incubations, was important. Multiplex sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed distinct ammonia oxidizer communities: AOB dominated numerically in Lake Lugano, and AOA dominated in the seawater. Potential for hybrid N2O formation exists among both communities, and at least in AOB-dominated environments, acidification may accelerate this mechanism.},

In the presence of clay minerals (montmorillonite and kaolinite), there was adsorption instead of precipitation. The cation concentration needed for adsorption depended on both the valence of the cations and the chemical nature of the nucleic acid molecules. Double-stranded nucleic acids needed higher cation concentrations than single-stranded ones to be adsorbed to the same extent on clay. Divalent cations were more efficient than monovalent ones in mediating adsorption. Adsorption to the clay occurred only when both nucleic acids and cations were present. However, once the complexes were formed, the cations could not be removed from the system by washing, indicating that they are directly involved in the association between nucleic acids and mineral surfaces. These observations indicate that cations take part directly in the formation of nucleic acid-clay complexes, acting as a ‘bridge’ between the negative charges on the mineral surface and those of the phosphate groups of the genetic polymer. The relatively low cation concentrations needed for adsorption and the ubiquitous presence of clay minerals in the environment suggest that the adsorption of nucleic acids on mineral surfaces could have taken place in prebiotic habitats. This may have played an important role in the formation and preservation of nucleic acids and/or their precursor polymers.},

  abstract = {Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in North America, encompasses a wide range of nutrient loading and trophic levels from the rivers and upper Bay to the sea, providing an ideal natural environment in which to explore relationships between functional diversity, physical/chemical complexity and ecosystem function (e.g. nitrification). In this study, amoA gene fragments (encoding subunit A of the key nitrification enzyme, ammonia monooxygenase) were PCR-amplified from DNA extracted from sediment cores collected at five stations spanning gradients of salinity, ammonium, nitrate, oxygen and organic carbon along the Bay and Choptank River, a subestuary of the Bay. Phylogenetic analysis of ∼30 amoA clones from each station revealed extensive diversity within the β-Proteobacteria group of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), with the vast majority of sequences falling into coherent phylogenetic clusters distinct from sequences of cultivated AOB. Over 70\% of the clones fell into two major phylogenetic clusters that appear to represent novel groups of Nitrosomonas-like and Nitrosospira-like amoA sequences that may be specific to estuarine and marine environments. Rarefaction analysis, estimators of genetic variation and dissimilarity indices all revealed differences in the relative amoA-based diversity and/or richness among most of the stations, with the highest diversity at the North Bay station and the lowest at the mesohaline stations. Although salinity appears to play a role, no single physical or chemical parameter entirely explains the pattern of diversity along the estuary, suggesting that a complex combination of environmental factors may shape the overall level of AOB diversity in this dynamic environment.},

Our approach to estimate the N               2               O production rates integrates the effects of potentially varying production and decomposition mechanisms along the transport path of a water mass. We estimate that the oceanic N               2               O production is dominated by nitrification with a contribution of only approximately 7 per cent by denitrification. This indicates that previously used approaches have overestimated the contribution by denitrification. Shelf areas may account for only a negligible fraction of the global production; however, estuarine sources and coastal upwelling of N               2               O are not taken into account in our study. The largest amount of subsurface N               2               O is produced in the upper 500 m of the water column. The estimated global annual subsurface N               2               O production ranges from 3.1 ± 0.9 to 3.4 ± 0.9 Tg N yr               −1               . This is in agreement with estimates of the global N               2               O emissions to the atmosphere and indicates that a N               2               O source in the mixed layer is unlikely. The potential future development of the oceanic N               2               O source in view of the ongoing changes of the ocean environment (deoxygenation, warming, eutrophication and acidification) is discussed.},

  abstract = {It is commonly accepted among origin-of-life scientists that the emergence of life was an evolutionary process involving at one stage or other the working of natural selection. Researchers disagree, however, on the nature of the chemical infrastructure that could have formed prebiotically, enabling the evolutionary process. The division of the origin-of-life research community into ‘geneticists’ and ‘metabolists’ usually revolves around the issue whether the first to arise prebiotically was a genetic polymer or a primitive metabolic system. In this paper I offer an alternative classification based on the attitude to the onset of natural selection. From this perspective I add to the conventional division between gene-first and metabolism-first groups a position I call “preparatory metabolism”. By this line of thought, an RNA or an RNA-like polymer could not have emerged prebiotically. Nevertheless, the onset of natural selection had to wait until such a polymer had arised. This paper examines the RNA-first, RNA-later, metabolism-first and preparatory-metabolism scenarios, assessing the weaknesses and strengths of each. I conclude that despite the recent theoretical advances in all these lines of research, and despite experimental breakthroughs, especially in overcoming several RNA-first hurdles, none of the examined paradigms has yet attained decisive experimental support. Demonstrating the evolvability of a potentially prebiotic infrastructure, whether genetic or metabolic, is a most serious challenge. So is the experimental demonstration of the emergence of such an infrastructure under prebiotic conditions. The current agenda before origin-of-life researchers of all stripes and colors is the search for the experimental means to tackle all these difficulties.},

Human activities have resulted in the fixation of an additional -150 Tg N year-’ by energy production, fertilizer production, and cultivation of crops (e.g., legumes, rice). Some sinks of anthropogenic N have been estimated (e.g., N,O accumulation in the atmosphere; loss to coastal oceans), however due to the uncertainty around the magnitude of other sinks (e.g., retention in groundwater, soils, or vegetation or denitrification to N2) a possibly large portion of the N fixed by humans is missing. While we know that N is accumulating in the environment, we do not know the rate of accumulation. Due to the myriad of effects of excess N on humans, ecosystems, and the atmosphere, and their cascading nature (i.e., one atom of N can have a large number of different effects as it is transformed to different N species), this lack of knowledge is unfortunate. There are limited options available to society to reduce the amount of N mobilized by human action because there is, in effect, a N imperative - it is required for food production. As population and per capita consumption of food (especially animal products) increase, more and more N will be converted from unreactive to reactive forms in the future. This is especially true in less developed regions.},

The same atom of Nr can cause multiple effects in the atmosphere, in terrestrial ecosystems, in freshwater and marine systems, and on human health. We call this sequence of effects the nitrogen cascade. As the cascade progresses, the origin of Nr becomes unimportant. Reactive nitrogen does not cascade at the same rate through all environmental systems; some systems have the ability to accumulate Nr, which leads to lag times in the continuation of the cascade. These lags slow the cascade and result in Nr accumulation in certain reservoirs, which in turn can enhance the effects of Nr on that environment. The only way to eliminate Nr accumulation and stop the cascade is to convert Nr back to nonreactive N2.},

Regional N budgets for Asia, North America, and other major regions for the early 1990s, as well as the marine N budget, are presented to highlight the dominant fluxes of nitrogen in each region. Important findings are that human activities increasingly dominate the N budget at the global and at most regional scales, the terrestrial and open ocean N budgets are essentially disconnected, and the fixed forms of N are accumulating in most environmental reservoirs. The largest uncertainties in our understanding of the N budget at most scales are the rates of natural biological nitrogen fixation, the amount of Nr storage in most environmental reservoirs, and the production rates of N2 by denitrification.},

  abstract = {Studying nitrous oxide (N2O) production and consumption processes along an intertidal elevation gradient can improve the understanding of N2O dynamics among coastal wetlands. A natural-abundance isotope technique was applied to characterize the processes responsible for N2O emission in high, middle and low intertidal zones in the Yangtze Estuary. The results showed that N2O emission rates in high tidal zones (0.84 ± 0.35 nmol g− 1 h− 1) were significantly higher than those in middle (0.21 ± 0.04 nmol g− 1 h− 1) and low tidal zones (0.26 ± 0.05 nmol g− 1 h− 1). Gross N2O production and consumption rates were greater in high and low tidal zones than in middle tidal zones, whereas N2O consumption proportions generally increased from high to low tidal zones. N2O consumption was quite pronounced, implying that N2O emission in estuarine wetlands accounts for only a small fraction of the total production. Higher degrees of N2O consumption were the pivotal driver of less N2O emission in low tidal zones. Bacterial denitrification ({$>$}84\%) was the dominant pathway, although hydroxylamine (NH2OH) oxidation/fungal denitrification contributed substantially to N2O production in high tidal flats. The contribution to N2O production exhibited a decrease in NH2OH oxidation/fungal denitrification and an increase in bacterial denitrification with decreasing elevation. Changes in N2O dynamics along the elevation gradient were affected by carbon and nitrogen substrate availabilities as well as the redox environments. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of N2O consumption in controlling N2O emission in intertidal wetlands, especially with higher inundation frequencies and durations.},

  abstract = {The origin and early evolution of life is generally studied under two different paradigms: bottom up and top down. Prebiotic chemistry and early Earth geochemistry allow researchers to explore possible origin of life scenarios. But for these “bottom–up” approaches, even successful experiments only amount to a proof of principle. On the other hand, “top–down” research on early evolutionary history is able to provide a historical account about ancient organisms, but is unable to investigate stages that occurred during and just after the origin of life. Here, we consider ancient electron transport chains (ETCs) as a potential bridge between early evolutionary history and a protocellular stage that preceded it. Current phylogenetic evidence suggests that ancestors of several extant ETC components were present at least as late as the last universal common ancestor of life. In addition, recent experiments have shown that some aspects of modern ETCs can be replicated by minerals, protocells, or organic cofactors in the absence of biological proteins. Here, we discuss the diversity of ETCs and other forms of chemiosmotic energy conservation, describe current work on the early evolution of membrane bioenergetics, and advocate for several lines of research to enhance this understanding by pairing top–down and bottom–up approaches.},

Valuable information on the shape and even on the composition of individual sEVs can be recorded using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Unfortunately, sample preparation for TEM image acquisition is a complex procedure, which often leads to noisy images and renders automatic quantification of sEVs an extremely difficult task. We present a completely deep-learning-based pipeline for the segmentation of sEVs in TEM images. Our method applies a residual convolutional neural network to obtain fine masks and use the Radon transform for splitting clustered sEVs. Using three manually annotated datasets that cover a natural variability typical for sEV studies, we show that the proposed method outperforms two different state-of-the-art approaches in terms of detection and segmentation performance. Furthermore, the diameter and roundness of the segmented vesicles are estimated with an error of less than 10\%, which supports the high potential of our method in biological applications.},

  abstract = {Scaling laws are a powerful way to compare genomes because they put all organisms onto a single curve and reveal nontrivial generalities as genomes change in size. The abundance of functional categories across genomes has previously been found to show power law scaling with respect to the total number of functional categories, suggesting that universal constraints shape genomic category abundance. Here, we look across the tree of life to understand how genome evolution may be related to functional scaling. We revisit previous observations of functional genome scaling with an expanded taxonomy by analyzing 3,726 bacterial, 220 archaeal, and 79 unicellular eukaryotic genomes. We find that for some functional classes, scaling is best described by multiple exponents, revealing previously unobserved shifts in scaling as genome-encoded protein annotations increase or decrease. Furthermore, we find that scaling varies between phyletic groups at both the domain and phyla levels and is less universal than previously thought. This variability in functional scaling is not related to taxonomic phylogeny re­ solved at the phyla level, suggesting that differences in cell plan or physiology outweigh broad patterns of taxonomic evo­ lution. Since genomes are maintained and replicated by the functional proteins encoded by them, these results point to functional degeneracy between taxonomic groups and unique evolutionary trajectories toward these. We also find that in­ dividual phyla frequently span scaling exponents of functional classes, revealing that individual clades can move across scaling exponents. Together, our results reveal unique shifts in functions across the tree of life and highlight that as genomes grow or shrink, proteins of various functions may be added or lost.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and the predominant ozone depleting substance. The only enzyme known to reduce N2O is the nitrous oxide reductase, encoded by the nosZ gene, which is present among bacteria and archaea capable of either complete denitrification or only N2O reduction to di-nitrogen gas. To determine whether the occurrence of nosZ, being a proxy for the trait N2O reduction, differed among taxonomic groups, preferred habitats or organisms having either NirK or NirS nitrite reductases encoded by the nirK and nirS genes, respectively, 652 microbial genomes across 18 phyla were compared. Furthermore, the association of different co-occurrence patterns with enzymes reducing nitric oxide to N2O encoded by nor genes was examined. We observed that co-occurrence patterns of denitrification genes were not randomly distributed across taxa, as specific patterns were found to be more dominant or absent than expected within different taxonomic groups. The nosZ gene had a significantly higher frequency of co-occurrence with nirS than with nirK and the presence or absence of a nor gene largely explained this pattern, as nirS almost always co-occurred with nor. This suggests that nirS type denitrifiers are more likely to be capable of complete denitrification and thus contribute less to N2O emissions than nirK type denitrifiers under favorable environmental conditions. Comparative phylogenetic analysis indicated a greater degree of shared evolutionary history between nosZ and nirS. However 30\% of the organisms with nosZ did not possess either nir gene, with several of these also lacking nor, suggesting a potentially important role in N2O reduction. Co-occurrence patterns were also non-randomly distributed amongst preferred habitat categories, with several habitats showing significant differences in the frequencies of nirS and nirK type denitrifiers. These results demonstrate that the denitrification pathway is highly modular, thus underpinning the importance of community structure for N2O emissions.},

  abstract = {Three strains of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria were cultured in artificial seawater medium under trace metal clean conditions to investigate their physiological response to changes in copper concentration. Decreasing the copper concentration in cultures of Pseudomonas stutzeri and Paracoccus denitrificans resulted in accumulation of nitrous oxide (N2O) gas compared to copper-replete cultures and cessation of growth before complete denitrification to dinitrogen. Correspondingly, the activity of the copper enzyme nitrous oxide reductase, measured for P. denitrificans cultures, was high in copper-replete cultures and was below detection in copper-deficient cultures. Addition of copper to copper-deficient cultures following the accumulation of N2O resulted in resumption of growth and complete consumption of N2O in solution. Growth of the third strain, WLB20, in copper-deficient medium caused a marked accumulation of nitrite, suggesting that WLB20 has the copper form of nitrite reductase. These observations suggest a role for trace metals in regulating redox cycling of nitrogen and trace gas production in the ocean.},

This information is expressed in a position-specific scoring table (profile), which is created from a group of sequences previously aligned by structural or sequence similarity. The similarity of any other sequence (target) to the group of aligned sequences (probe) can be tested by comparing the target to the profile using dynamic programming algorithms. The profile method differs in two major respects from methods of sequence comparison in common use: (i) Any number of known sequences can be used to construct the profile, allowing more information to be used in the testing of the target than is possible with pairwise alignment methods. (it) The profile includes the penalties for insertion or deletion at each position, which allow one to include the probe secondary structure in the testing scheme. Tests with globin and immunoglobulin sequences show that profile analysis can distinguish all members of these families from all other sequences in a database containing 3800 protein sequences.},

  abstract = {In the coming decades and centuries, the ocean’s biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems will become increasingly stressed by at least three independent factors. Rising temperatures, ocean acidification and ocean deoxygenation will cause substantial changes in the physical, chemical and biological environment, which will then affect the ocean’s biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems in ways that we are only beginning to fathom. Ocean warming will not only affect organisms and biogeochemical cycles directly, but will also increase upper ocean stratification. The changes in the ocean’s carbonate chemistry induced by the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO               2               ) (i.e. ocean acidification) will probably affect many organisms and processes, although in ways that are currently not well understood. Ocean deoxygenation, i.e. the loss of dissolved oxygen (O               2               ) from the ocean, is bound to occur in a warming and more stratified ocean, causing stress to macro-organisms that critically depend on sufficient levels of oxygen. These three stressors—warming, acidification and deoxygenation—will tend to operate globally, although with distinct regional differences. The impacts of ocean acidification tend to be strongest in the high latitudes, whereas the low-oxygen regions of the low latitudes are most vulnerable to ocean deoxygenation. Specific regions, such as the eastern boundary upwelling systems, will be strongly affected by all three stressors, making them potential hotspots for change. Of additional concern are synergistic effects, such as ocean acidification-induced changes in the type and magnitude of the organic matter exported to the ocean’s interior, which then might cause substantial changes in the oxygen concentration there. Ocean warming, acidification and deoxygenation are essentially irreversible on centennial time scales, i.e. once these changes have occurred, it will take centuries for the ocean to recover. With the emission of CO               2               being the primary driver behind all three stressors, the primary mitigation strategy is to reduce these emissions.},

Hypoxia and ocean acidification are becoming more intense as a result of climate change. The former stimulates N               2               O emissions, whereas the effects of the latter on N               2               O production vary by the ocean. Hypoxia and ocean acidification may play a critical role in the evolution of future oceanic N               2               O production. However, the interactive effects of hypoxia and ocean acidification on N               2               O production remain unclear. We conducted a research cruise in the Bohai Sea of China to assess the occurrence of ocean acidification in the seasonal oxygen minimum zone of the sea and further conducted laboratory incubation experiments to determine the effects of ocean acidification and hypoxia on N               2               O production.

In contrast, hypoxia had a positive impact; when dissolved oxygen (DO) decreased to 3.7 and 2.4 mg L               −1               , N               2               O production increased by 49.72 and 278.68\%, respectively. The incubation experiments demonstrated that the coupling of ocean acidification and hypoxia significantly increased N               2               O production, but, individually, there was an antagonistic relationship between the two. Structural equation modeling showed that the total effects of hypoxia treatment on N               2               O production changes weakened the effects of ocean acidification, with overall positive effects. Generally speaking, our results suggest that N               2               O production from the coastal waters of the Bohai Sea may increase under future climate change scenarios due to increasingly serious ocean acidification and hypoxia working in combination.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The formation of carbohydrates represents an essential step to provide building blocks and a source of chemical energy in several models for the emergence of life. Formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde and a basic catalyst are the initial components forming a variety of sugar molecules in the cascade-type multi-step formose reaction. While numerous side reactions and even deterioration can be observed in aqueous media, selective prebiotic sugar formation is feasible in solid-state, mechanochemical reactions and might have occurred in early geochemistry. However, the precise role of different basic catalysts and the influence of the atmospheric conditions in the solid-state formose reaction remain unknown. Here we show, that in a primordial scenario the mechanochemical formose reaction is capable to form monosaccharides with a broad variety of mineral classes as catalysts with only minute amounts of side products such as lactic acid or methanol, independent of the atmospheric conditions. The results give insight into recent findings of formose sugars on meteorites and offer a water-free and robust pathway for monosaccharides independent of the external conditions both for the early Earth or an extra-terrestrial setting.},

  abstract = {Understanding the Earth’s geological nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) cycles is fundamental for assessing the distribution of these volatiles between solid Earth (core, mantle and crust), oceans and atmosphere. This Special Communication about the Earth’s N and C cycles contains material that is relevant for researchers who are interested in the Topical Collection on planetary evolution “Reading Terrestrial Planet Evolution in Isotopes and Element Measurements”. Variations in the fluxes of N and C between these major reservoirs through geological time influenced the evolution and determined the unique composition of the Earth’s atmosphere. Here we review several key geological aspects of the N and C cycles of which our understanding has significantly advanced during the last decade through field-based, experimental and theoretical studies. Subduction zones are the most important pathway of both N and C from the Earth’s surface into the deep Earth. A key question in the flux quantification is how much of the volatile elements is stored in the downgoing slab and introduced into the mantle and how much is returned back to the surface and the atmosphere through arc magmatism. For N, the retention of N as NH+4 in minerals has a major influence on fluxes between reservoirs. The temperature-dependent stability of NH+4 -bearing minerals determines whether N is predominantly retained in the slab to mantle depths (in subduction zones with a low geothermal gradient) or devolatilized (in subduction zones with a high geothermal gradient). Several lines of evidence suggest that the mantle is regassing with respect to N due to a net influx of subducted N over time, but this issue is highly debated and evidence to the contrary also exists. Nevertheless, there is consensus that the majority of the planetary N budget is stored in the Earth’s mantle, with the continental crust also constituting a significant N reservoir. For C, release from the subducting slab occurs through decarbonation reactions, dissolution and formation of carbonatitic liquids, but reprecipitation of C in the slab or the forearc mantle wedge may limit the effectiveness of direct return of C into the atmosphere. Carbon release through regional metamorphism in collision zone orogens also has potentially profound effects on C release into the atmosphere and consensus has emerged that such orogens are sources rather than sinks of atmospheric CO2. On shorter timescales, contact metamorphism through interaction of mantle-derived magmas with Cbearing country rocks, and the resulting release of large quantities of CH4 and/or CO2, has been linked to global warming events.},

  abstract = {A new method for the mathematical analysis of large metabolic networks is presented. Based on the fact that the occurrence of a metabolic reaction generally requires the existence of other reactions providing its substrates, series of metabolic networks are constructed. In each step of the corresponding expansion process those reactions are incorporated whose substrates are made available by the networks of the previous generations. The method is applied to the set of all metabolic reactions included in the KEGG database. Starting with one or more seed compounds, the expansion results in a final network whose compounds define the scope of the seed. Scopes of all metabolic compounds are calculated and it is shown that large parts of cellular metabolism can be considered as the combined scope of simple building blocks. Analyses of various expansion processes reveal crucial metabolites whose incorporation allows for the increase in network complexity. Among these metabolites are common cofactors such as NAD+, ATP, and coenzyme A. We demonstrate that the outcome of network expansion is in general very robust against elimination of single or few reactions. There exist, however, crucial reactions whose elimination results in a dramatic reduction of scope sizes. It is hypothesized that the expansion process displays characteristics of the evolution of metabolism such as the temporal order of the emergence of metabolic pathways.},

Using these types we predict broad nutritional requirements for 447 organisms, providing clues for possible environments from the knowledge of their metabolic networks.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves               1               and in the first imaging of a black hole               2               . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

  abstract = {A protometabolic approach to the origins of life assumes that the conserved biochemistry of metabolism has direct continuity with prebiotic chemistry. One of the most important amino acids in modern biology is aspartic acid, serving as a nodal metabolite for the synthesis of many other essential biomolecules. Aspartate’s prebiotic synthesis is complicated by the instability of its precursor, oxaloacetate. In this paper, we show that the use of the biologically relevant cofactor pyridoxamine, supported by metal ion catalysis, is sufficiently fast to offset oxaloacetate’s degradation. Cu2+-catalysed transamination of oxaloacetate by pyridoxamine achieves around a 5\% yield within 1 h, and can operate across a broad range of pH, temperature, and pressure. In addition, the synthesis of the downstream product β-alanine may also take place in the same reaction system at very low yields, directly mimicking an archaeal synthesis route. Amino group transfer supported by pyridoxal is shown to take place from aspartate to alanine, but the reverse reaction (alanine to aspartate) shows a poor yield. Overall, our results show that the nodal metabolite aspartate and related amino acids can indeed be synthesised via protometabolic pathways that foreshadow modern metabolism in the presence of the simple cofactor pyridoxamine and metal ions.},

CO2 fixation within protocells generates a reaction network with a topology that prefigures the universal core of metabolism. Positive feedback loops amplify flux through this network, giving a metabolic heredity that promotes growth. Patterns in the genetic code show that genes and proteins arose through direct biophysical interactions between amino acids and nucleotides in this protometabolic network. Random genetic sequences template nonrandom peptides, producing selectable function in growing protocells.

  abstract = {The Hadean Eon, encompassing Earth’s first 550 million years, was a time of significant planetary evolution. Nevertheless, prebiotic Earth’s near-surface environment may have held no more than approximately 420 different rock-forming or accessory mineral species that were widely distributed and/or volumetrically significant. This relative Hadean mineralogical parsimony is a consequence of the limited modes of mineral paragenesis prior to 4 Ga compared to the last 3.0 billion years. Dominant Hadean Eon mineralizing processes include the evolution of a diverse suite of intrusive and extrusive igneous lithologies; hydrothermal alteration over a wide temperature range, notably serpentinization; authigenesis in marine sediments; diagenesis and low-grade metamorphism in near-surface environments; and impactrelated processes, including shock mineralization, creation of marginal hydrothermal zones, and excavation of deep metamorphosed terrains. On the other hand, the Hadean Eon may have been notably lacking in mineralization generated by plate tectonic processes, such as subduction zone volcanism and associated fluid-rock interactions, which result in massive sulfide deposition; convergent boundary orogenesis and consequent extensive granitoid-rooted continental landmasses; and the selection and concentration of incompatible elements in complex pegmatites, with hundreds of accompanying minerals. The dramatic mineralogical consequences of life are reflected in the absence of Hadean biomineralization; for example, the lack of extensive carbonate deposits and the associated restricted development of skarn and cave minerals prior to 4 Ga. Most importantly, it was not until after the establishment via photosynthesis of significant near-surface redox gradients that supergene alteration, redox-controlled ore deposition, and subaerial weathering in an oxidizing environment could diversify Earth’s near-surface mineralogy. These post-Hadean processes may be responsible for over 4000 of the more than 4800 approved mineral species. Any scenario for life’s origins that invokes minerals as agents of molecular synthesis, selection, protection, or organization must take into account the limited mineralogical repertoire of the time.},

  abstract = {The diffusion of molecules on interstellar grain surfaces is one of the most important driving forces for the molecular complexity in the interstellar medium. Due to the lack of laboratory measurements, astrochemical modeling of grain surface processes usually assumes a constant ratio between the diffusion energy barrier and the desorption energy. This over-simplification inevitably causes large uncertainty in model predictions. We present a new measurement of the diffusion of CO2 molecules on the surface of non-porous amorphous solid water (np-ASW), an analog of the ice mantle that covers cosmic dust grains. A small coverage of CO2 was deposited onto an np-ASW surface at 40 K, the subsequent warming of the ice activated the diffusion of CO2 molecules, and a transition from isolated CO2 to CO2 clusters was seen in the infrared spectra. To obtain the diffusion energy barrier and pre-exponential factor simultaneously, a set of isothermal experiments were carried out. The values for the diffusion energy barrier and pre-exponential factor were found to be 1300 ± 110 K and 107.6±0.8 s−1. A comparison with prior laboratory measurements on diffusion is discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Abrupt changes in ocean biogeochemical variables occur as a result of human-induced climate forcing as well as those which are more gradual and occur over longer timescales. These abrupt changes have not yet been identified and quantified to the same extent as the more gradual ones. We review and synthesise abrupt changes in ocean biogeochemistry under human-induced climatic forcing. We specifically address the ocean carbon and oxygen cycles because the related processes of acidification and deoxygenation provide important ecosystem hazards. Since biogeochemical cycles depend also on the physical environment, we also describe the relevant changes in warming, circulation, and sea ice. We include an overview of the reversibility or irreversibility of abrupt marine biogeochemical changes. Important implications of abrupt biogeochemical changes for ecosystems are also discussed. We conclude that there is evidence for increasing occurrence and extent of abrupt changes in ocean biogeochemistry as a consequence of rising greenhouse gas emissions.},

  abstract = {It is generally considered that nitrogen availability is one of the major factors regulating primary production in temperate coastal marine environments. Coastal regions often receive large anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen that cause eutrophication. The impact of these nitrogen additions has a profound effect in estuaries and coastal lagoons where water exchange is limited. Such increased nutrient loading promotes the growth of phytoplankton and fast growing pelagic macroalgae while rooted plants (sea-grasses) and benthic are suppressed due to reduced light availability. This shift from benthic to pelagic primary production introduces large diurnal variations in oxygen concentrations in the water column. In addition oxygen consumption in the surface sediments increases due to the deposition of readily degradable biomass. In this review the physico-chemical and biological factors regulating nitrogen cycling in coastal marine ecosystems are considered in relation to developing effective management programmes to rehabilitate seagrass communities in lagoons currently dominated by pelagic macroalgae and/or cyanobacteria. ß 1999 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

  abstract = {Darwinian evolution requires a mechanism for generation of diversity in a population, and selective differences between individuals that influence reproduction. In biology, diversity is generated by mutations and selective differences arise because of the encoded functions of the sequences (e.g., ribozymes or proteins). Here, I draw attention to a process that I will call chemical evolution, in which the diversity is generated by random chemical synthesis instead of (or in addition to) mutation, and selection acts on physicochemical properties, such as hydrolysis, photolysis, solubility, or surface binding. Chemical evolution applies to short oligonucleotides that can be generated by random polymerization, as well as by templatedirected replication, and which may be too short to encode a specific function. Chemical evolution is an important stage on the pathway to life, between the stage of ‘‘just chemistry’’ and the stage of full biological evolution. A mathematical model is presented here that illustrates the differences between these three stages. Chemical evolution leads to much larger differences in molecular concentrations than can be achieved by selection without replication. However, chemical evolution is not open-ended, unlike biological evolution. The ability to undergo Darwinian evolution is often considered to be a defining feature of life. Here, I argue that chemical evolution, although Darwinian, does not quite constitute life, and that a good place to put the conceptual boundary between non-life and life is between chemical and biological evolution.},

We determined the kinetics of growth and turnover of nitric oxide (NO) and N               2               O at low cell densities of               Nitrosomonas europaea               (AOB) and               Nitrosopumilus maritimus               (AOA) during gradual depletion of TAN (NH               3               \,+\,                              ) and O               2               . Half‐saturation constants for O               2               and TAN were similar to those determined by others, except for the half‐saturation constant for ammonium in               N. maritimus               (0.2 mM), which is orders of magnitudes higher than previously reported. For both strains, cell‐specific rates of NO turnover and N               2               O production reached maxima near O               2               half‐saturation constant concentration (2–10 μM O               2               ) and decreased to zero in response to complete O               2               ‐depletion. Modelling of the electron flow in               N. europaea               demonstrated low electron flow to denitrification (≤1.2\% of the total electron flow), even at sub‐micromolar O               2               concentrations. The results corroborate current understanding of the role of NO in the metabolism of AOA and suggest that denitrification is inconsequential for the energy metabolism of AOB, but possibly important as a route for dissipation of electrons at high ammonium concentration.},

  abstract = {Surface ocean biogeochemistry and photochemistry regulate ocean–atmosphere fluxes of trace gases critical for Earth's atmospheric chemistry and climate. The oceanic processes governing these fluxes are often sensitive to the changes in ocean pH (or               p               CO               2               ) accompanying ocean acidification (OA), with potential for future climate feedbacks. Here, we review current understanding (from observational, experimental and model studies) on the impact of OA on marine sources of key climate-active trace gases, including dimethyl sulfide (DMS), nitrous oxide (N               2               O), ammonia and halocarbons. We focus on DMS, for which available information is considerably greater than for other trace gases. We highlight OA-sensitive regions such as polar oceans and upwelling systems, and discuss the combined effect of multiple climate stressors (ocean warming and deoxygenation) on trace gas fluxes. To unravel the biological mechanisms responsible for trace gas production, and to detect adaptation, we propose combining process rate measurements of trace gases with longer term experiments using both model organisms in the laboratory and natural planktonic communities in the field. Future ocean observations of trace gases should be routinely accompanied by measurements of two components of the carbonate system to improve our understanding of how               in situ               carbonate chemistry influences trace gas production. Together, this will lead to improvements in current process model capabilities and more reliable predictions of future global marine trace gas fluxes.},

Although NO is a potent oxidant, and was available on Earth earlier than oxygen, it is unclear whether NO can be used by microorganisms for growth. Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria couple nitrite reduction to ammonium oxidation with NO and hydrazine as intermediates, and produce N               2               and nitrate. Here, we show that the anammox bacterium               Kuenenia stuttgartiensis               is able to grow in the absence of nitrite by coupling ammonium oxidation to NO reduction, and produce only N               2               . Under these growth conditions, the transcription of proteins necessary for NO generation is downregulated. Our work has potential implications in the control of N               2               O and NO emissions from natural and manmade ecosystems, where anammox bacteria contribute significantly to N               2               release to the atmosphere.

  abstract = {Significance                            Biology is built of organic molecules, which originate primarily from the reduction of CO               2               through several carbon-fixation pathways. Only one of these—the Wood–Ljungdahl acetyl-CoA pathway—is energetically profitable overall and present in both Archaea and Bacteria, making it relevant to studies of the origin of life. We used geologically pertinent, life-like microfluidic pH gradients across freshly deposited Fe(Ni)S precipitates to demonstrate the first step of this pathway: the otherwise unfavorable production of formate (HCOO               –               ) from CO               2               and H               2               . By separating CO               2               and H               2               into acidic and alkaline conditions—as they would have been in early-Earth alkaline hydrothermal vents—we demonstrate a mild indirect electrochemical mechanism of pH-driven carbon fixation relevant to life’s emergence, industry, and environmental chemistry.                        ,                             All life on Earth is built of organic molecules, so the primordial sources of reduced carbon remain a major open question in studies of the origin of life. A variant of the alkaline-hydrothermal-vent theory for life’s emergence suggests that organics could have been produced by the reduction of CO               2               via H               2               oxidation, facilitated by geologically sustained pH gradients. The process would be an abiotic analog—and proposed evolutionary predecessor—of the Wood–Ljungdahl acetyl-CoA pathway of modern archaea and bacteria. The first energetic bottleneck of the pathway involves the endergonic reduction of CO               2               with H               2               to formate (HCOO               –               ), which has proven elusive in mild abiotic settings. Here we show the reduction of CO               2               with H               2               at room temperature under moderate pressures (1.5 bar), driven by microfluidic pH gradients across inorganic Fe(Ni)S precipitates. Isotopic labeling with               13               C confirmed formate production. Separately, deuterium (               2               H) labeling indicated that electron transfer to CO               2               does not occur via direct hydrogenation with H               2               but instead, freshly deposited Fe(Ni)S precipitates appear to facilitate electron transfer in an electrochemical-cell mechanism with two distinct half-reactions. Decreasing the pH gradient significantly, removing H               2               , or eliminating the precipitate yielded no detectable product. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of spatially separated yet electrically coupled geochemical reactions as drivers of otherwise endergonic processes. Beyond corroborating the ability of early-Earth alkaline hydrothermal systems to couple carbon reduction to hydrogen oxidation through biologically relevant mechanisms, these results may also be of significance for industrial and environmental applications, where other redox reactions could be facilitated using similarly mild approaches.},

  abstract = {The concept of an autocatalytic network of reactions that can form and persist, starting from just an available food source, has been formalised by the notion of a Reflexively-Autocatalytic and Food generated (RAF) set. The theory and algorithmic results concerning RAFs have been applied to a range of settings, from metabolic questions arising at the origin of life, to ecological networks, and cognitive models in cultural evolution. In this paper, we present new structural and algorithmic results concerning RAF sets, the identification of irreducible RAFs, and determining when certain reactions must occur before other reactions in a RAF (or, more generally, any F-generated set). We also describe how RAF theory extends to allow certain reactions to not require catalysis, and/or to require only catalysts that are not present in the food set, as well as to find minimal sets that are both a RAF and produce a given subset of elements. In all cases, the theory leads to efficient (polynomial-time) algorithms. We also briefly illustrate applications of RAF theory to two evolutionary processes in biology, namely, early metabolism and modelling the evolution of holobionts.},

In this Review, we discuss the wealth of new ocean nitrogen cycle research in disciplines from metaproteomics to global biogeochemical modelling and in environments from productive estuaries to the abyssal deep sea. Influential recent discoveries include new microbial functional groups, novel metabolic pathways, original conceptual perspectives and ground-breaking analytical capabilities. These emerging research directions are already contributing to urgent efforts to address the primary challenge facing marine microbiologists today: the unprecedented onslaught of anthropogenic environmental change on marine ecosystems. Ocean warming, acidification, nutrient enrichment and seawater stratification have major effects on the microbial nitrogen cycle, but widespread ocean deoxygenation is perhaps the most consequential for the microorganisms involved in both aerobic and anaerobic nitrogen transformation pathways. In turn, these changes feed back to the global cycles of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. At a time when our species casts a lengthening shadow across all marine ecosystems, timely new advances offer us unique opportunities to understand and better predict human impacts on nitrogen biogeochemistry in the changing ocean of the Anthropocene.},

Increasing the number of correct identifications, both of genes and of the translation initiation sites for each gene, and reducing the overall number of false positives, are all desirable goals. Results: With our years of experience in manually curating genomes for the Joint Genome Institute, we developed a new gene prediction algorithm called Prodigal (PROkaryotic DYnamic programming Gene-finding ALgorithm). With Prodigal, we focused specifically on the three goals of improved gene structure prediction, improved translation initiation site recognition, and reduced false positives. We compared the results of Prodigal to existing gene-finding methods to demonstrate that it met each of these objectives. Conclusion: We built a fast, lightweight, open source gene prediction program called Prodigal http://compbio.ornl. gov/prodigal/. Prodigal achieved good results compared to existing methods, and we believe it will be a valuable asset to automated microbial annotation pipelines.},

This paper presents a comprehensive review of biogeochemical models and explores their applications in different marine ecosystems. It also assesses their performance in reproducing key biogeochemical components, such as chlorophyll-a, nutrients, carbon, and oxygen cycles. The study focuses on four distinct zones: tropical, temperate, polar/subpolar, and high nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC). Each zone exhibits unique physical and biogeochemical characteristics, which are defined and used to evaluate the models’ performance. While biogeochemical models have demonstrated the ability to simulate various ecosystem components, limitations and assumptions persist. Thus, this review addresses these limitations and discusses the challenges and future developments of biogeochemical models. Key areas for improvement involve incorporating missing components such as viruses, archaea, mixotrophs, refining parameterizations for nitrogen transformations, detritus representation, and considering the interactions of fish and zooplankton within the models.},

  abstract = {The Eastern Tropical South Pacific oxygen minimum zone (ETSP-OMZ) is a site of intense nitrous oxide (N2O) flux to the atmosphere. This flux results from production of N2O by nitrification and denitrification, but the contribution of the two processes is unknown. The rates of these pathways and their distributions were measured directly using 15N tracers. The highest N2O production rates occurred at the depth of peak N2O concentrations at the oxic-anoxic interface above the oxygen deficient zone (ODZ) because slightly oxygenated waters allowed (1) N2O production from both nitrification and denitrification and (2) higher nitrous oxide production yields from nitrification. Within the ODZ proper (i.e., anoxia), the only source of N2O was denitrification (i.e., nitrite and nitrate reduction), the rates of which were reflected in the abundance of nirS genes (encoding nitrite reductase). Overall, denitrification was the dominant pathway contributing the N2O production in the ETSP-OMZ.},

The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation.

In analogy to modern soda lakes commonly associated with volcanic regions, it is postulated that the ancient sea had a high alkalinity, a high pH and low Ca and Mg concentrations. The change towards NaCl dominance as observed in the present-day ocean can best be explained by a series of mineral equilibria, crustal differentiation and life processes. In principle hydrothermal leaching of chlorine from the oceanic crust caused this ion to accumulate in the sea while at the same time dissolved carbonates became gradually removed by organisms and carbonates. The switch from a soda to a halite ocean was accomplished - 1 Ga ago. Critical biochemical events marking the chemical evolution of the Precambrian sea and their implications for the PCO\textasciitilde{} in air will be discussed.},

Alkaline oceans (nicknamed “soda oceans” in analogy to terrestrial soda lakes) have been hypothesized also for early Earth and Mars on the basis of mass balance considerations involving total amounts of acids available for weathering and the composition of the early crust. Such an environment could be favorable to biogenesis since it may have provided for very low Ca21 concentrations mandatory for the biochemical function of proteins. A rapid loss of CO2 from Europa’s atmosphere may have led to freezing oceans. Alkaline brine bubbles embedded in ice in freezing and impact-thawing oceans could have provided a suitable environment for protocell formation and the large number of trials needed for biogenesis. Understanding these processes could be central to assessing the probability of life on Europa. Key Words: Biogenesis—Ocean chemistry—Soda ocean—Alkalinity—Europa—Lake Van. Astrobiology 2, 123–130.},

  abstract = {One present obstacle to the “RNA-first” model for the origin of life is an inability to generate reasonable “hands off” scenarios for the formation of carbohydrates under conditions where they might have survived for reasonable times once formed. Such scenarios would be especially compelling if they deliver pent(ul)oses, five-carbon sugars found in terran genetics, and exclude other carbohydrates (e.g., aldotetroses) that may also be able to function in genetic systems. Here, we provide detailed chemical analyses of carbohydrate premetabolism, showing how borate, molybdate, and calcium minerals guide the formation of tetroses (C4H8O4), heptoses (C7H14O7), and pentoses (C5H10O5), including the ribose found in RNA, in “hands off” experiments, starting with formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde. These results show that pent(ul)oses would almost certainly have formed as stable borate complexes on the surface of an early Earth beneath a humid CO2 atmosphere suffering electrical discharge. While aldotetroses form extremely stable complexes with borate, they are not accessible by pathways plausible under the most likely early Earth scenarios. The stabilization by borate is not, however, absolute. Over longer times, material is expected to have passed from borate-bound pent(ul)oses to a branched heptulose, which is susceptible to Cannizzaro reduction to give dead end products. We show how this fate might be avoided using molybdate-catalyzed rearrangement of a branched pentose that is central to borate-moderated cycles that fix carbon from formaldehyde. Our emerging understanding of the nature of the early Earth, including the presence of hydrated rocks undergoing subduction to form felsic magmas in the early Hadean eon, may have made borate and molydate species available to prebiotic chemistry, despite the overall “reduced” state of the planet.},

  abstract = {How and where did life on Earth originate? To date, various environments have been proposed as plausible sites for the origin of life. However, discussions have focused on a limited stage of chemical evolution, or emergence of a specific chemical function of proto-biological systems. It remains unclear what geochemical situations could drive all the stages of chemical evolution, ranging from condensation of simple inorganic compounds to the emergence of self-sustaining systems that were evolvable into modern biological ones. In this review, we summarize reported experimental and theoretical findings for prebiotic chemistry relevant to this topic, including availability of biologically essential elements (N and P) on the Hadean Earth, abiotic synthesis of life’s building blocks (amino acids, peptides, ribose, nucleobases, fatty acids, nucleotides, and oligonucleotides), their polymerizations to bio-macromolecules (peptides and oligonucleotides), and emergence of biological functions of replication and compartmentalization. It is indicated from the overviews that completion of the chemical evolution requires at least eight reaction conditions of (1) reductive gas phase, (2) alkaline pH, (3) freezing temperature, (4) fresh water, (5) dry/dry-wet cycle, (6) coupling with high energy reactions, (7) heating-cooling cycle in water, and (8) extraterrestrial input of life’s building blocks and reactive nutrients. The necessity of these mutually exclusive conditions clearly indicates that life’s origin did not occur at a single setting; rather, it required highly diverse and dynamic environments that were connected with each other to allow intratransportation of reaction products and reactants through fluid circulation. Future experimental research that mimics the conditions of the proposed model are expected to provide further constraints on the processes and mechanisms for the origin of life.},

Ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) are key players in the nitrogen cycle and major producers of N               2               O and NO globally. However, nothing is known about N               2               O and NO production by the recently discovered and widely distributed complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox). Here, we show that the comammox bacterium               Nitrospira inopinata               is sensitive to inhibition by an NO scavenger, cannot denitrify to N               2               O, and emits N               2               O at levels that are comparable to AOA but much lower than AOB.

Our findings indicate that comammox microbes may produce less N               2               O during nitrification than AOB.},

  abstract = {There are three groups of scientists dominating the search for the origin of life: the organic chemists (the Soup), the molecular biologists (RNA world), and the inorganic chemists (metabolism and transient-state metal ions), all of which have experimental adjuncts. It is time for Clays and the Origin of Life to have its experimental adjunct. The clay data coming from Mars and carbonaceous chondrites have necessitated a review of the role that clays played in the origin of life on Earth. The data from Mars have suggested that Fe-clays such as nontronite, ferrous saponites, and several other clays were formed on early Mars when it had sufficient water. This raised the question of the possible role that these clays may have played in the origin of life on Mars. This has put clays front and center in the studies on the origin of life not only on Mars but also here on Earth. One of the major questions is: What was the catalytic role of Fe-clays in the origin and development of metabolism here on Earth? First, there is the recent finding of a chiral amino acid (isovaline) that formed on the surface of a clay mineral on several carbonaceous chondrites. This points to the formation of amino acids on the surface of clay minerals on carbonaceous chondrites from simpler molecules, e.g., CO2, NH3, and HCN. Additionally, there is the catalytic role of small organic molecules, such as dicarboxylic acids and amino acids found on carbonaceous chondrites, in the formation of Fe-clays themselves. Amino acids and nucleotides adsorb on clay surfaces on Earth and subsequently polymerize. All of these observations and more must be subjected to strict experimental analysis. This review provides an overview of what has happened and is now happening in the experimental clay world related to the origin of life. The emphasis is on smectite-group clay minerals, such as montmorillonite and nontronite.},

  abstract = {The onset and cessation of the synthesis of denitrification enzymes of Pseudomonas stutzeri were investigated by using continuous culture and defined dissolved oxygen levels covering the full range of transition from air saturation to complete anaerobiosis. Expression of nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase (cytochrome cd1), and N2O reductase was controlled by discrete oxygen levels and by the nature of the nitrogenous oxide available for respiration. N2O reductase was synthesized constitutively at a low level; for enhanced expression, oxygen concentrations were required to decrease below 5 mg of O2 per liter. The threshold values for synthesis of nitrate reductase and cytochrome cd1 in the presence of nitrate were ca. 5 and ca. 2.5 mg of O2 per liter, respectively. With nitrous oxide as the respiratory substrate, nitrite reductase was again the most sensitive to oxygen concentration; however, thresholds for all denitrification enzymes shifted to lower oxygen levels. Whereas the presence of nitrate resulted in maximum expression and nearly uniform induction of all reductases, nitrite and nitrous oxide stimulated preferably the respective enzyme catalyzing reduction. In the absence of a nitrogenous oxide, anaerobiosis did not induce enzyme synthesis to any significant degree. The accumulation of nitrite seen during both the aerobic-anaerobic and anaerobic-aerobic transition phases was caused by the differences in onset or cessation of synthesis of nitrate and nitrite reductases and an inhibitory effect of nitrate on nitrite reduction.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            Nitrite reductase (NirK) and nitric oxide reductase (NorB) have long been thought to play an essential role in nitrous oxide (N               2               O) production by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. However, essential gaps remain in our understanding of how and when NirK and NorB are active and functional, putting into question their precise roles in N               2               O production by ammonia oxidizers. The growth phenotypes of the               Nitrosomonas europaea               ATCC 19718 wild-type and mutant strains deficient in expression of NirK, NorB, and both gene products were compared under atmospheric and reduced O               2               tensions. Anoxic resting-cell assays and instantaneous nitrite (NO               2               −               ) reduction experiments were done to assess the ability of the wild-type and mutant               N. europaea               strains to produce N               2               O through the nitrifier denitrification pathway. Results confirmed the role of NirK for efficient substrate oxidation of               N. europaea               and showed that NorB is involved in N               2               O production during growth at both atmospheric and reduced O               2               tensions. Anoxic resting-cell assays and measurements of instantaneous NO               2               −               reduction using hydrazine as an electron donor revealed that an alternate nitrite reductase to NirK is present and active. These experiments also clearly demonstrated that NorB was the sole nitric oxide reductase for nitrifier denitrification. The results of this study expand the enzymology for nitrogen metabolism and N               2               O production by               N. europaea               and will be useful to interpret pathways in other ammonia oxidizers that lack NirK and/or NorB genes.},

Here, we present a comprehensive large scale characterization of modularity across the bacterial tree of life, systematically quantifying the modularity of the metabolic networks of {$>$}300 bacterial species. Three main determinants of metabolic network modularity are identified. First, network size is an important topological determinant of network modularity. Second, several environmental factors influence network modularity, with endosymbionts and mammal-specific pathogens having lower modularity scores than bacterial species that occupy a wider range of niches. Moreover, even among the pathogens, those that alternate between two distinct niches, such as insect and mammal, tend to have relatively high metabolic network modularity. Third, horizontal gene transfer is an important force that contributes significantly to metabolic modularity. We additionally reconstruct the metabolic network of ancestral bacterial species and examine the evolution of modularity across the tree of life. This reveals a trend of modularity decrease from ancestors to descendants that is likely the outcome of niche specialization and the incorporation of peripheral metabolic reactions.},

The phenotypic profile of EV populations is a promising reporter of disease, with direct clinical diagnostic relevance. Yet, robust methods for quantifying the biomarker content of EV have been critically lacking, and require a single‐particle approach due to their inherent heterogeneous nature. Here, multicolor single‐molecule burst analysis microscopy is used to detect multiple biomarkers present on single EV. The authors classify the recorded signals and apply the machine learning‐based t‐distributed stochastic neighbor embedding algorithm to cluster the resulting multidimensional data. As a proof of principle, the authors use the method to assess both the purity and the inflammatory status of EV, and compare cell culture and plasma‐derived EV isolated via different purification methods. This methodology is then applied to identify intercellular adhesion molecule‐1 specific EV subgroups released by inflamed endothelial cells, and to prove that apolipoprotein‐a1 is an excellent marker to identify the typical lipoprotein contamination in plasma. This methodology can be widely applied on standard confocal microscopes, thereby allowing both standardized quality assessment of patient plasma EV preparations, and diagnostic profiling of multiple EV biomarkers in health and disease.},

With the possible exception of nucleotides, low adsorption of organomonomers on sediment surfaces of a prebiotic ocean (pH 8) is expected, and significant condensation is considered unlikely. In dehydrated and frozen systems, high surface concentrations are probable and condensation is more likely. In fluctuating environments, condensation rates will be enhanced and the size distribution of the oligomers formed during dehydration may be influenced by a "redistribution mechanism" in which adsorbed oligomers and monomers are desorbed and redistributed on the solid surface during the next hydration-dehydration cycle.},

Thus, studies are mainly limited to controlled simulations of likely reactions in early Earth conditions. Similarly, chemical reactions in the laboratory may generate the products necessary for biosynthesis, but may nevertheless be geochemically irrelevant.                                Lambert                 et al.                              (p.               984               ) show that silicate ions, present in Earth's surface waters at relatively high concentrations, catalyze the formation of four- and six-carbon sugars from simple sugars via the formose reaction. The resulting complexes stabilize the sugar molecules, allowing sugars to accumulate in greater abundance. Silicate stabilization also circumvents the need for the formose reaction to proceed at high temperatures, thus extending the range of possible environments in which life could have originated.                        ,              Sugar growth and stabilization catalyzed by silicate ions is a possible prebiotic synthetic pathway.           ,              Understanding the mechanism of sugar formation and stabilization is important for constraining theories on the abiotic origin of complex biomolecules. Although previous studies have produced sugars from small molecules through the formose and related reactions, the product mixtures are complex and unstable. We have demonstrated that simple two- and three-carbon molecules (glycolaldehyde and glyceraldehyde), in the presence of aqueous sodium silicate, spontaneously form silicate complexes of four- and six-carbon sugars, respectively. Silicate selects for sugars with a specific stereochemistry and sequesters them from rapid decomposition. Given the abundance of silicate minerals, these observations suggest that formose-like reactions may provide a feasible pathway for the abiotic formation of biologically important sugars, such as ribose.},

The influence of the pre-existing mineral world on the organization of matter towards the living state may have manifested at several steps in the rise towards higher complexity. Small biomolecules such as amino acids formed on mineral surfaces of interstellar dust, meteorites or comets prior to their delivery to the primordial Earth. Mineral surfaces are known to promote the polymerization of these small molecules to the corresponding biopolymers (e.g. amino acids to proteins), and they may have oriented this polymerization to the formation of specific structures. Crucial steps of protometabolism could have originated on the surface of sulfide minerals. The most daring view of the prebiotic role of minerals holds that some of them may have carried genetic information subject to darwinian selection prior to the rise of nucleic acids, today’s genetic material. Finally, porous structures ranging from the nanometer to the micrometer probably helped protect the first proto-organisms from dilution and other damage. Future studies are expected to see progress towards molecular-level characterization, and to start accounting for the complexity of the prebiotic environment.},

  abstract = {Monosaccharides represent one of the major building blocks of life. One of the plausible prebiotic synthesis routes is the formose network, which generates sugars from C1 and C2 carbon sources in basic aqueous solution. We report on the feasibility of the formation of monosaccharides under physical forces simulated in a ball mill starting from formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde, DL-glyceraldehyde as prebiotically available substrates using catalytically active, basic minerals. We investigated the influence of the mechanic energy input on our model system using calcium hydroxide in an oscillatory ball mill. We show that the synthesis of monosaccharides is kinetically accelerated under mechanochemical conditions. The resulting sugar mixture contains monosaccharides with straight and branched carbon chains as well as decomposition products. In comparison to the sugar formation in water, the monosaccharides formed under mechanochemical conditions are more stable and selectively synthesized. Our results imply the possibility of a prebiotic monosaccharide origin in geochemical environments scant or devoid of water promoted by mechanochemical forces such as meteorite impacts or lithospheric activity.},

  abstract = {There is currently no consensus on how humans are affecting the marine nitrogen (N) cycle, which limits marine biological production and CO2 uptake. Anthropogenic changes in ocean warming, deoxygenation, and atmospheric N deposition can all individually affect the marine N cycle and the oceanic production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). However, the combined effect of these perturbations on marine N cycling, ocean productivity, and marine N2O production is poorly understood. Here we use an Earth system model of intermediate complexity to investigate the combined effects of estimated 21st century CO2 atmospheric forcing and atmospheric N deposition. Our simulations suggest that anthropogenic perturbations cause only a small imbalance to the N cycle relative to preindustrial conditions (∼+5 Tg N y−1 in 2100). More N loss from water column denitrification in expanded oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) is counteracted by less benthic denitrification, due to the stratification-induced reduction in organic matter export. The larger atmospheric N load is offset by reduced N inputs by marine N2 fixation. Our model predicts a decline in oceanic N2O emissions by 2100. This is induced by the decrease in organic matter export and associated N2O production and by the anthropogenically driven changes in ocean circulation and atmospheric N2O concentrations. After comprehensively accounting for a series of complex physical-biogeochemical interactions, this study suggests that N flux imbalances are limited by biogeochemical feedbacks that help stabilize the marine N inventory against anthropogenic changes. These findings support the hypothesis that strong negative feedbacks regulate the marine N inventory on centennial time scales.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive investigation of ribosomal genes in complete genomes from 66 different species allows us to address the distribution of r-proteins between and within the three primary domains. Thirty-four r-protein families are represented in all domains but 33 families are speci®c to Archaea and Eucarya, providing evidence for specialisation at an early stage of evolution between the bacterial lineage and the lineage leading to Archaea and Eukaryotes. With only one speci®c r-protein, the archaeal ribosome appears to be a small-scale model of the eukaryotic one in terms of protein composition. However, the mechanism of evolution of the protein component of the ribosome appears dramatically different in Archaea. In Bacteria and Eucarya, a restricted number of ribosomal genes can be lost with a bias toward losses in intracellular pathogens. In Archaea, losses implicate 15\% of the ribosomal genes revealing an unexpected plasticity of the translation apparatus and the pattern of gene losses indicates a progressive elimination of ribosomal genes in the course of archaeal evolution. This ®rst documented case of reductive evolution at the domain scale provides a new framework for discussing the shape of the universal tree of life and the selective forces directing the evolution of prokaryotes.},

They have extensive use in the biomedical and chemical fields; however, in prebiotic chemistry, they only have been employed recently. In prebiotic chemistry, just three types of microfluidic devices have been used: the first ones are Y-form devices with laminar co-flow, used to study the precipitation of minerals in hydrothermal vents systems; the second ones are microdroplet devices that can form small droplets capable of mimic cellular compartmentalization; and the last ones are devices with microchambers that recreate the microenvironment inside rock pores under hydrothermal conditions. In this review, we summarized the experiments in the field of prebiotic chemistry that employed microfluidic devices. The main idea is to incentivize their use and discuss their potential to perform novel experiments that could contribute to unraveling some prebiotic chemistry questions.},

We first review the literature on the prebiotic synthesis of the nucleotides, the nonenzymatic synthesis and copying of polynucleotides, and the selection of ribozyme catalysts of a kind that might have facilitated polynucleotide replication. This leads to a brief outline of the Molecular Biologists’ Dream, an optimistic scenario for the origin of the RNA World. In the second part of the review we point out the many unresolved problems presented by the Molecular Biologists’ Dream. This in turn leads to a discussion of genetic systems simpler than RNA that might have “invented” RNA. Finally, we review studies of prebiotic membrane formation.},

In this chapter, we describe some of the pioneering work in Reverse Ecology, demonstrating how system-level analysis of complex biological networks can be used to predict the natural habitats of poorly characterized microbial species, their interactions with other species, and universal patterns governing the adaptation of organisms to their environments. We further present several studies that applied Reverse Ecology to elucidate various aspects of microbial ecology, and lay out exciting future directions and potential future applications in biotechnology, biomedicine, and ecological engineering.},

  abstract = {A transition from geochemistry to biochemistry has been considered as a necessary step towards the emergence of primordial life. Nevertheless, how did this transition occur is still elusive. The chemistry underlying this transition is likely not a single event, but involves many levels of creation and reconstruction, finally reaching the molecular, structural, and functional buildup of complexity. Among them, one apparent question is: how the biochemical catalytic system emerged from the mineral-based geochemical system? Inspired by the metal–ligand structures in metalloenzymes, many researchers have proposed that transition metal sulfide minerals could have served as structural analogs of metalloenzymes for catalyzing prebiotic redox conversions. This assumption has been tested and verified to some extent by several studies, which focused on using Earth-abundant transition metal sulfides as catalysts for multi-electron C and N conversions. The progress in this field will be introduced, with a focus on the CO2 fixation and ammonia synthesis from nitrate/nitrite reduction and N2 reduction. Recently developed methods for screening effective mineral catalysts were also reviewed.},

In order to evaluate sediment community responses to short-term (tidal) and long-term (seasonal) changes in different tidal regimes, nitrogen cycling rates and genes were quantified in three sites that span a range of tidal influence in the upper portion of the Cape Fear River Estuary. Environmental parameters were monitored during low and high tides in winter and spring. 15N tracer incubation experiments were conducted to measure nitrification, denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA). Abundances of functional genes including bacterial and archaeal ammonia monooxygenase (amoA), nitrite reductases (nirS and nrfA), nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), and hydrazine oxidoreductase (hzo) were measured using quantitative PCR assays. Denitrification rates were highest among the measured N cycling processes while bacteria carrying nrfA genes were most abundant. A discernable pattern in the short-term variation of N cycling rates and gene abundance was not apparent under the different tidal regimes. Significant seasonal variation in nitrification, denitrification, and anammox rates as well as bacterial amoA, nirS and nosZ gene abundance was observed, largely explained by increases in substrate availability during winter, with sediment ammonium playing a central role. These results suggest that the coupling of nitrification to N removal pathways is primarily driven by organic carbon mineralization and independent of tidal or salinity changes. Finally, changes in denitrification and nitrification activities were strongly reflected by the abundance of the respective functional genes, supporting a linkage between the structure and function of microbial communities.},

  abstract = {The formation of the Earth as a planet was a large stochastic process in which the rapid assembly of asteroidal-to-Mars-sized bodies was followed by a more extended period of growth through collisions of these objects, facilitated by the gravitational perturbations associated with Jupiter. The Earth's inventory of water and organic molecules may have come from diverse sources, not more than 10\% roughly from comets, the rest from asteroidal precursors to chondritic bodies and possibly objects near Earth's orbit for which no representative class of meteorites exists today in laboratory collections. The final assembly of the Earth included a catastrophic impact with a Mars-sized body, ejecting mantle and crustal material to form the Moon, and also devolatilizing part of the Earth. A magma ocean and steam atmosphere (possibly with silica vapour) existed briefly in this period, but terrestrial surface waters were below the critical point within 100 million years after Earth's formation, and liquid water existed continuously on the surface within a few hundred million years. Organic material delivered by comets and asteroids would have survived, in part, this violent early period, but frequent impacts of remaining debris probably prevented the continuous habitability of the Earth for one to several hundred million years. Planetary analogues to or records of this early time when life began include Io (heat flow), Titan (organic chemistry) and Venus (remnant early granites).},

  abstract = {In this study, the effects of increasing copper (Cu) concentrations on the denitrification pathway and on the diversity of a denitrifier community and gene expression were evaluated in intertidal sandy sediments of the Douro River estuary (north-west Portugal). The results demonstrated that sediment denitrification rates were highly affected by Cu; almost complete inhibition (85\%) of the process was observed in sediments amended with 60 mg Cu gÀ1 wet wt sediment. Moreover, the addition of Cu stimulated the accumulation of both N2O and NOÀ2 and inhibited the rate of NOÀ3 uptake. Further, the amendment with even the lowest Cu concentration (4 mg Cu gÀ1 wet wt sediment) yielded a drastic decrease in the abundance of nirK, nirS and nosZ (between 79\% and 81\%) assessed by means of real-time PCR. In agreement, reverse transcription-PCR–denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of nirK, nirS and nosZ transcripts showed a progressive decrease in the diversity of the transcription products of these genes with an increase of the Cu concentration.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Nitrogen (N) input to the coastal oceans has increased considerably because of anthropogenic activities, however, concurrent increases have not occurred in open oceans. It has been suggested that benthic denitrification in sandy coastal sediments is a sink for this N. Sandy sediments are dynamic permeable environments, where electron acceptor and donor concentrations fluctuate over short temporal and spatial scales. The response of denitrifiers to these fluctuations are largely unknown, although previous observations suggest they may denitrify under aerobic conditions. We examined the response of benthic denitrification to fluctuating oxygen concentrations, finding that denitrification not only occurred at high O2 concentrations but was stimulated by frequent switches between oxic and anoxic conditions. Throughout a tidal cycle, in situtranscription of genes for aerobic respiration and denitrification were positively correlated within diverse bacterial classes, regardless of O2 concentrations, indicating that denitrification gene transcription is not strongly regulated by O2 in sandy sediments. This allows microbes to respond rapidly to changing environmental conditions, but also means that denitrification is utilized as an auxiliary respiration under aerobic conditions when imbalances occur in electron donor and acceptor supply. Aerobic denitrification therefore contributes significantly to N-loss in permeable sediments making the process an important sink for anthropogenic N-inputs.},

  abstract = {Summary                            Coastal oceans receive large amounts of anthropogenic fixed nitrogen (N), most of which is denitrified in the sediment before reaching the open ocean. Sandy sediments, which are common in coastal regions, seem to play an important role in catalysing this N‐loss. Permeable sediments are characterized by advective porewater transport, which supplies high fluxes of organic matter into the sediment, but also leads to fluctuations in oxygen and nitrate concentrations. Little is known about how the denitrifying communities in these sediments are adapted to such fluctuations. Our combined results indicate that denitrification in eutrophied sandy sediments from the world's largest tidal flat system, the Wadden Sea, is carried out by different groups of microorganisms. This segregation leads to the formation of N               2               O which is advectively transported to the overlying waters and thereby emitted to the atmosphere. At the same time, the production of N               2               O within the sediment supports a subset of               Flavobacteriia               which appear to be specialized on N               2               O reduction. If the mechanisms shown here are active in other coastal zones, then denitrification in eutrophied sandy sediments may substantially contribute to current marine N               2               O emissions.},

This approach allows us to identify molecular biosignatures from a set of diverse samples from around the world, outer space, and the laboratory, demonstrating it is possible to build a life detection experiment based on MA that could be deployed to extraterrestrial locations, and used as a complexity scale to quantify constraints needed to direct prebiotically plausible processes in the laboratory.

Here, we assess the capacity for untargeted metatranscriptomics to resolve spatiotemporal differences in the microbial contribution to benthic nitrogen cycling. The most abundant sediment transcripts assembled were associated with the archaeal nitrifier Nitrosopumilus. In sediments close to external inputs of organic nitrogen, the dominant transcripts were associated with Nitrosopumilus nitric oxide nitrite reduction (nirK). The environmental conditions close to organic nitrogen inputs that select for increased transcription in Nitrosopumilus (amoCAB, nirK, nirS, nmo, hcp) additionally selected for increased transcription of bacterial nitrite reduction (nxrB) and transcripts associated with anammox (hzo) but not denitrification (bacterial nirS/nirk). In sediments that are more isolated from external inputs of organic nitrogen dominant transcripts were associated with nitrous oxide reduction (nosZ) and changes in nosZ transcript abundance were uncoupled from transcriptional profiles associated with archaeal nitrification. Coordinated transcription of coupled communitylevel nitrification–denitrification was not well supported by metatranscriptomics. In comparison, the abundance of archaeal nirK transcripts were site- and season-specific. This study indicates that the transcription of archaeal nirK in response to changing environmental conditions may be an important and overlooked feature of coastal sediment nitrogen cycling.},

  abstract = {A model for the origin of biochemistry at an alkaline hydrothermal vent has been developed that focuses on the acetyl-CoA (Wood–Ljungdahl) pathway of CO               2               fixation and central intermediary metabolism leading to the synthesis of the constituents of purines and pyrimidines. The idea that acetogenesis and methanogenesis were the ancestral forms of energy metabolism among the first free-living eubacteria and archaebacteria, respectively, stands in the foreground. The synthesis of formyl pterins, which are essential intermediates of the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway and purine biosynthesis, is found to confront early metabolic systems with steep bioenergetic demands that would appear to link some, but not all, steps of CO               2               reduction to geochemical processes in or on the Earth's crust. Inorganically catalysed prebiotic analogues of the core biochemical reactions involved in pterin-dependent methyl synthesis of the modern acetyl-CoA pathway are considered. The following compounds appear as probable candidates for central involvement in prebiotic chemistry: metal sulphides, formate, carbon monoxide, methyl sulphide, acetate, formyl phosphate, carboxy phosphate, carbamate, carbamoyl phosphate, acetyl thioesters, acetyl phosphate, possibly carbonyl sulphide and eventually pterins. Carbon might have entered early metabolism via reactions hardly different from those in the modern Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, the pyruvate synthase reaction and the incomplete reverse citric acid cycle. The key energy-rich intermediates were perhaps acetyl thioesters, with acetyl phosphate possibly serving as the universal metabolic energy currency prior to the origin of genes. Nitrogen might have entered metabolism as geochemical NH               3               via two routes: the synthesis of carbamoyl phosphate and reductive transaminations of α-keto acids. Together with intermediates of methyl synthesis, these two routes of nitrogen assimilation would directly supply all intermediates of modern purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis. Thermodynamic considerations related to formyl pterin synthesis suggest that the ability to harness a naturally pre-existing proton gradient at the vent–ocean interface via an ATPase is older than the ability to generate a proton gradient with chemistry that is specified by genes.},

  abstract = {The question concerning the meaning of life is important, but it immediately confronts the present authors with insurmountable obstacles from a philosophical standpoint, as it would require us to define not only what we hold to be life, but what we hold to be meaning in addition, requiring us to do both in a properly researched context. We unconditionally surrender to that challenge. Instead, we offer a vernacular, armchair approach to life’s origin and meaning, with some layman’s thoughts on the meaning of origins as viewed from the biologist’s standpoint. One can observe that biologists generally approach the concept of biological meaning in the context of evolution. This is the basis for the broad resonance behind Dobzhansky’s appraisal that “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution”. Biologists try to understand living things in the historical context of how they arose, without giving much thought to the definition of what life or living things are, which for a biologist is usually not an interesting question in the practical context of daily dealings with organisms. Do humans generally understand life’s meaning in the context of history? If we consider the problem of life’s origin, the question of what constitutes a living thing becomes somewhat more acute for the biologist, though not more answerable, because it is inescapable that there was a time when there were no organisms on Earth, followed by a time when there were, the latter time having persisted in continuity to the present. This raises the question of where, in that transition, chemicals on Earth became alive, requiring, in turn, a set of premises for how life arose in order to conceptualize the problem in relation to organisms we know today, including ourselves, which brings us to the point of this paper: In the same way that cultural narratives for origins always start with a setting, scientific narratives for origins also always start with a setting, a place on Earth or elsewhere where we can imagine what happened for the sake of structuring both the problem and the narrative for its solution. This raises the question of whether scientific origins settings convey meaning to humans in that they suggest to us from what kind of place and what kinds of chemicals we are descended, that is, to which inanimate things we are most closely related.},

  abstract = {Reconstruction of the Tree of Life is a central goal in biology. Although numerous novel phyla of bacteria and archaea have recently been discovered, inconsistent phylogenetic relationships are routinely reported, and many inter-phylum and inter-domain evolutionary relationships remain unclear. Here, we benchmark different marker genes often used in constructing multidomain phylogenetic trees of bacteria and archaea and present a set of marker genes that perform best for multidomain trees constructed from concatenated alignments. We use recently-developed Tree Certainty metrics to assess the confidence of our results and to obviate the complications of traditional bootstrap-based metrics. Given the vastly disparate number of genomes available for different phyla of bacteria and archaea, we also assessed the impact of taxon sampling on multidomain tree construction. Our results demonstrate that biases between the representation of different taxonomic groups can dramatically impact the topology of resulting trees. Inspection of our highest-quality tree supports the division of most bacteria into Terrabacteria and Gracilicutes, with Thermatogota and Synergistota branching earlier from these superphyla. This tree also supports the inclusion of the Patescibacteria within the Terrabacteria as a sister group to the Chloroflexota instead of as a basal-branching lineage. For the Archaea, our tree supports three monophyletic lineages (DPANN, Euryarchaeota, and TACK/Asgard), although we note the basal placement of the DPANN may still represent an artifact caused by biased sequence composition. Our findings provide a robust and standardized framework for multidomain phylogenetic reconstruction that can be used to evaluate inter-phylum relationships and assess uncertainty in conflicting topologies of the Tree of Life.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The ocean is a substantial source of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere, but little is known about how this flux might change in the future. Here, we investigate the potential evolution of marine N2O emissions in the 21st century in response to anthropogenic climate change using the global ocean biogeochemical model NEMO-PISCES. Assuming nitrification as the dominant N2O formation pathway, we implemented two different parameterizations of N2O production which differ primarily under low-oxygen (O2) conditions. When forced with output from a climate model simulation run under the business-as-usual high-CO2 concentration scenario (RCP8.5), our simulations suggest a decrease of 4 to 12 \% in N2O emissions from 2005 to 2100, i.e., a reduction from 4.03/3.71 to 3.54/3.56 TgN yr−1 depending on the parameterization. The emissions decrease strongly in the western basins of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, while they tend to increase above the oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), i.e., in the eastern tropical Pacific and in the northern Indian Ocean. The reduction in N2O emissions is caused on the one hand by weakened nitrification as a consequence of reduced primary and export production, and on the other hand by stronger vertical stratification, which reduces the transport of N2O from the ocean interior to the ocean surface. The higher emissions over the OMZ are linked to an expansion of these zones under global warming, which leads to increased N2O production, associated primarily with denitrification. While there are many uncertainties in the relative contribution and changes in the N2O production pathways, the increasing storage seems unequivocal and determines largely the decrease in N2O emissions in the future. From the perspective of a global climate system, the averaged feedback strength associated with the projected decrease in oceanic N2O emissions amounts to around −0.009 W m−2 K−1, which is comparable to the potential increase from terrestrial N2O sources. However, the assessment for a potential balance between the terrestrial and marine feedbacks calls for an improved representation of N2O production terms in fully coupled next-generation Earth system models.},

Clay and mineral surfaces are important for concentrating the reactants and for promoting nucleotide polymerization reactions. Using classical molecular dynamics methods we provide atomic details of reactant conformations prior to polynucleotide formation, lending insight into previously reported experimental observations of this phenomenon. The simulations clarify the catalytic role of metal ions, demonstrate that reactions leading to correct linkages take place primarily in the interlayer, and explain the observed sequence selectivity in the elongation of the chain. The study comparing reaction probabilities involving Land D-chiral forms of the reactants has found enhancement of homochiral over heterochiral products when catalyzed by montmorillonite.},

To the best of our knowledge, however, no model of a proliferating prebiotic system has yet been realised because different conditions are required for polymer generation and self-assembly. In this study, we identify conditions suitable for concurrent peptide generation and self-assembly, and we show how a proliferating peptide-based droplet could be created by using synthesised amino acid thioesters as prebiotic monomers. Oligopeptides generated from the monomers spontaneously formed droplets through liquid–liquid phase separation in water. The droplets underwent a steady growth–division cycle by periodic addition of monomers through autocatalytic self-reproduction. Heterogeneous enrichment of RNA and lipids within droplets enabled RNA to protect the droplet from dissolution by lipids. These results provide experimental constructs for origins-of-life research and open up directions in the development of peptide-based materials.},

These distributions (i.e., fractionations) have been intensively studied in sediments corresponding to various Earth ages, as well as in laboratory-based culture studies. A central finding has been that isotope fractionation occurs with high variability, leading to questions of what drives this. In this chapter we discuss some of the sources of this variability. To build a picture of this, we deal with three different scales: the enzyme level, the cell level, and the ecosystem level. To compare and contrast, we discuss the isotope fractionation of carbon from CO2 in water-oxidizing phototrophs which utilize the Calvin cycle (i.e., the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle), and the fractionation of sulfur in sulfate during microbial sulfate reduction to hydrogen sulfide. Overall, we attempt to provide some background and fodder for future integration across these scales, where it is the collective challenge of researchers from multiple disciplines to elucidate what a particular isotope ratio observed in a natural system may represent.},

  abstract = {Protein coordinated iron-sulfur clusters drive electron flow within metabolic pathways for organisms throughout the tree of life. It is not known how iron-sulfur clusters were first incorporated into proteins. Structural analogies to iron-sulfide minerals present on early Earth, suggest a connection in the evolution of both proteins and minerals. The availability of large protein and mineral crystallographic structure data sets, provides an opportunity to explore co-evolution of proteins and minerals on a large-scale using informatics approaches. However, quantitative comparisons are confounded by the infinite, repeating nature of the mineral lattice, in contrast to metal clusters in proteins, which are finite in size. We address this problem using the Niggli reduction to transform a mineral lattice to a finite, unique structure that when translated reproduces the crystal lattice. Protein and reduced mineral structures were represented as quotient graphs with the edges and nodes corresponding to bonds and atoms, respectively. We developed a graph theory-based method to calculate the maximum common connected edge subgraph (MCCES) between mineral and protein quotient graphs. MCCES can accommodate differences in structural volumes and easily allows additional chemical criteria to be considered when calculating similarity. To account for graph size differences, we use the Tversky similarity index. Using consistent criteria, we found little similarity between putative ancient iron-sulfur protein clusters and iron-sulfur mineral lattices, suggesting these metal sites are not as evolutionarily connected as once thought. We discuss possible evolutionary implications of these findings in addition to suggesting an alternative proxy, mineral surfaces, for better understanding the coevolution of the geosphere and biosphere.},

  abstract = {It is generally assumed that the complex map of metabolism is a result of natural selection working at the molecular level. However, natural selection can only work on entities that have three basic features: information, metabolism and membrane. Metabolism must include the capability of producing all cellular structures, as well as energy (ATP), from external sources; information must be established on a material that allows its perpetuity, in order to safeguard the goals achieved; and membranes must be able to preserve the internal material, determining a selective exchange with external material in order to ensure that both metabolism and information can be individualized. It is not difficult to understand that protocellular entities that boast these three qualities can evolve through natural selection. The problem is rather to explain the origin of such features under conditions where natural selection could not work. In the present work we propose that these protocells could be built by chemical evolution, starting from the prebiotic primordial soup, by means of chemical selection. This consists of selective increases of the rates of certain specific reactions because of the kinetic or thermodynamic features of the process, such as stoichiometric catalysis or autocatalysis, cooperativity and others, thereby promoting their prevalence among the whole set of chemical possibilities. Our results show that all chemical processes necessary for yielding the basic materials that natural selection needs to work may be achieved through chemical selection, thus suggesting a way for life to begin. r 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Estuarine sediments contribute substantially to global N2O emission originating from marine environments, and it is often speculated whether nitrification or denitrification is the most significant process contributing to N2O production in soils and sediments. These processes are driven by different precursor compounds, biotic and abiotic variables, and improved causal understanding is required for minimising N2O emission rates. In the present study, we used microsensors to measure porewater profiles of NOx−, NO2−, O2 and N2O to determine how N2O is produced under high nutrient conditions in a mangrove sediment. These microsensors allow measurement of the rates and vertical location of nitrification and denitrification (NOx− reduction) at sub-millimeter scale. Production of N2O can then be associated with each process. Sediment cores from the fringe of a subtropical mangrove forest were analysed in the laboratory to a depth of 10 mm. Production of N2O under low nutrient conditions was below the detection limit of the sensor, but simulating eutrophication scenarios by adding NH4+ or NO3−, led to N2O production from both nitrification and denitrification. Under NH4+-rich conditions, N2O production contributed to 5.4 and 18\% of the N turnover of from nitrification and denitrification, respectively. Although denitrification produced more N2O, nitrification was the more important process for sediment N2O emission. Nitrous oxide originating from denitrification was produced in deeper sediment layers, and mostly consumed within the sediment, whereas N2O originating from nitrification was produced close to the sediment surface, allowing N2O to diffuse to the overlying water and the atmosphere. This result stresses the importance of considering both actual production rates from each process, and their vertical position in the sediment with regard to diffusive transport to the sediment surface.},

  abstract = {Core gene phylogenies provide a window into early evolution, but different gene sets and analytical methods have yielded substantially different views of the tree of life. Trees inferred from a small set of universal core genes have typically supported a long branch separating the archaeal and bacterial domains. By contrast, recent analyses of a broader set of non-­ribosomal genes have suggested that Archaea may be less divergent from Bacteria, and that estimates of inter-­domain distance are inflated due to accelerated evolution of ribosomal proteins along the inter-­domain branch. Resolving this debate is key to determining the diversity of the archaeal and bacterial domains, the shape of the tree of life, and our understanding of the early course of cellular evolution. Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of the marker genes key to the debate. We show that estimates of a reduced Archaea-­Bacteria (AB) branch length result from inter-d­ omain gene transfers and hidden paralogy in the expanded marker gene set. By contrast, analysis of a broad range of manually curated marker gene datasets from an evenly sampled set of 700 Archaea and Bacteria reveals that current methods likely underestimate the AB branch length due to substitutional saturation and poor model fit; that the best-p­ erforming phylogenetic markers tend to support longer inter-­domain branch lengths; and that the AB branch lengths of ribosomal and non-r­ibosomal marker genes are statistically indistinguishable. Furthermore, our phylogeny inferred from the 27 highest-­ranked marker genes recovers a clade of DPANN at the base of the Archaea and places the bacterial Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) within Bacteria as the sister group to the Chloroflexota.},

Age estimates for LUCA are usually based on the fossil record, varying with every reinterpretation. The nature of LUCA’s metabolism has proven equally contentious, with some attributing all core metabolisms to LUCA, whereas others reconstruct a simpler life form dependent on geochemistry. Here we infer that LUCA lived \textasciitilde 4.2\,Ga (4.09–4.33\,Ga) through divergence time analysis of pre-LUCA gene duplicates, calibrated using microbial fossils and isotope records under a new cross-bracing implementation. Phylogenetic reconciliation suggests that LUCA had a genome of at least 2.5\,Mb (2.49–2.99\,Mb), encoding around 2,600 proteins, comparable to modern prokaryotes. Our results suggest LUCA was a prokaryote-grade anaerobic acetogen that possessed an early immune system. Although LUCA is sometimes perceived as living in isolation, we infer LUCA to have been part of an established ecological system. The metabolism of LUCA would have provided a niche for other microbial community members and hydrogen recycling by atmospheric photochemistry could have supported a modestly productive early ecosystem.},

Additional mineral diversity arises from the occurrence of some mineral species that form more than one ‘natural kind’, each with distinct chemical and morphological characteristics that arise by different paragenetic processes. Rare minerals, for example those containing essential B, Mo, or P, are not necessary for the origins of life. Rather, many common minerals incorporate those and other elements as trace and minor constituents. A rich variety of chemically reactive sites were thus available at the exposed surfaces of common Hadean rock-forming minerals.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION             A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a probabilistic model of a multiple sequence alignment (msa) of proteins. In the model, each column of symbols in the alignment is represented by a frequency distribution of the symbols (called a “state”), and insertions and deletions are represented by other states. One moves through the model along a particular path from state to state in a Markov chain (i.e., random choice of next move), trying to match a given sequence. The next matching symbol is chosen from each state, recording its probability (frequency) and also the probability of going to that state from a previous one (the transition probability). State and transition probabilities are multiplied to obtain a probability of the given sequence. The hidden nature of the HMM is due to the lack of information about the value of a specific state, which is instead represented by a probability distribution over all possible values. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of HMMs in msa and presents algorithms for calculating an HMM and the conditions for producing the best HMM.},

In contrast, fine-grained reconstructions of ancestral genome organizations are still in their infancy, limiting our ability to draw comprehensive views of genome and karyotype evolution. Here we reconstruct the detailed gene contents and organizations of 624 ancestral vertebrate, plant, fungi, metazoan and protist genomes, 183 of which are near-complete chromosomal gene order reconstructions. Reconstructed ancestral genomes are similar to their descendants in terms of gene content as expected and agree precisely with reference cytogenetic and in silico reconstructions when available. By comparing successive ancestral genomes along the phylogenetic tree, we estimate the intra- and interchromosomal rearrangement history of all major vertebrate clades at high resolution. This freely available resource introduces the possibility to follow evolutionary processes at genomic scales in chronological order, across multiple clades and without relying on a single extant species as reference.},

  abstract = {Nitrous oxide is a powerful, long-lived greenhouse gas, but we know little about the role of estuarine areas in the global N2O budget. This review summarizes 56 studies of N2O fluxes and associated biogeochemical controlling factors in estuarine open waters, salt marshes, mangroves, and intertidal sediments. The majority of in situ N2O production occurs as a result of sediment denitrification, although the water column contributes N2O through nitrification in suspended particles. The most important factors controlling N2O fluxes seem to be dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and oxygen availability, which in turn are affected by tidal cycles, groundwater inputs, and macrophyte density. The heterogeneity of coastal environments leads to a high variability in observations, but on average estuarine open water, intertidal and vegetated environments are sites of a small positive N2O flux to the atmosphere (range 0.15–0.91; median 0.31; Tg N2O-N yrÀ1). Global changes in macrophyte distribution and anthropogenic nitrogen loading are expected to increase N2O emissions from estuaries. We estimate that a doubling of current median NO3À concentrations would increase the global estuary water–air N2O flux by about 0.45 Tg N2O-N yrÀ1 or about 190\%. A loss of 50\% of mangrove habitat, being converted to unvegetated intertidal area, would result in a net decrease in N2O emissions of 0.002 Tg N2O-N yrÀ1. In contrast, conversion of 50\% of salt marsh to unvegetated area would result in a net increase of 0.001 Tg N2O-N yrÀ1. Decreased oxygen concentrations may inhibit production of N2O by nitrification; however, sediment denitrification and the associated ratio of N2O:N2 is expected to increase.},

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as “modularity” over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

  abstract = {Energy metabolism in extant life is centered around phosphate and the energy-dense phosphoanhydride bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a deeply conserved and ancient bioenergetic system. Yet, ATP synthesis relies on numerous complex enzymes and has an autocatalytic requirement for ATP itself. This implies the existence of evolutionarily simpler bioenergetic pathways and potentially primordial alternatives to ATP. The centrality of phosphate in modern bioenergetics, coupled with the energetic properties of phosphorylated compounds, may suggest that primordial precursors to ATP also utilized phosphate in compounds such as pyrophosphate, acetyl phosphate and polyphosphate. However, bioavailable phosphate may have been notably scarce on the early Earth, raising doubts about the roles that phosphorylated molecules might have played in the early evolution of life. A largely overlooked phosphorus redox cycle on the ancient Earth might have provided phosphorus and energy, with reduced phosphorus compounds potentially playing a key role in the early evolution of energy metabolism. Here, we speculate on the biological phosphorus compounds that may have acted as primordial energy currencies, sources of environmental energy, or sources of phosphorus for the synthesis of phosphorylated energy currencies. This review encompasses discussions on the evolutionary history of modern bioenergetics, and specifically those pathways with primordial relevance, and the geochemistry of bioavailable phosphorus on the ancient Earth. We highlight the importance of phosphorus, not only in the form of phosphate, to early biology and suggest future directions of study that may improve our understanding of the early evolution of bioenergetics.},

There is nowadays a handful of prebiotically plausible scenarios that enable the laboratory synthesis of most amino acids, fatty acids, simple sugars, nucleotides and core metabolites of extant living organisms. The major bottleneck then seems to be the self-organization of those building blocks into systems that can self-sustain. The purpose of this tutorial review is having a close look, guided by experimental research, into the main synthetic pathways of prebiotic chemistry, suggesting how they could be wired through common intermediates and catalytic cycles, as well as how recursively changing conditions could help them engage in self-organized and dissipative networks/assemblies (               i.e.               , systems that consume chemical or physical energy from their environment to maintain their internal organization in a dynamic steady state out of equilibrium). In the article we also pay attention to the implications of this view for the emergence of homochirality. The revealed connectivity between those prebiotic routes should constitute the basis for a robust research program towards the bottom-up implementation of protometabolic systems, taken as a central part of the origins-of-life problem. In addition, this approach should foster further exploration of control mechanisms to tame the combinatorial explosion that typically occurs in mixtures of various reactive precursors, thus regulating the functional integration of their respective chemistries into self-sustaining protocellular assemblies.},

The fitness criterion for this evolution is taken to be the the stability (conservation) of domains in the protocellular membrane as determined by non-covalent molecular associations between the amphiphiles of the membrane and a subset of the macromolecules in the protocell. In the presence of a source of free energy the macromolecular content of the protocell (co-)evolves as the result of (domain-dependent) membrane-catalysed polymerisation of the prebiotic constituents delivered to the protocell by fusion. The metabolism of the cell therefore (co-)evolves on a rugged fitness landscape. We indicate how domain evolution with the same fitness criterion can potentially give rise to coding. Membrane domains may therefore provide the link between protocells and the RNA/DNA-world.},

  abstract = {Quantification of adsorption processes on clay mineral surfaces is often necessary to predict the extent and the evolution of contaminants’ migration in surficial and underground environments. Many studies have been dedicated to retention measurement as a function of pH and ionic strength in relation with the two main identified adsorption processes for clay minerals, that is, cation exchange on their basal surfaces and surface complexation on their edge surfaces. The latest process has been repeatedly assessed as an effective retention mechanism at circumneutral pH conditions, which often prevail in natural environments. This assessment must however be tempered by the lack of information about competitive processes that can take place with the numerous chemical species present in natural settings, compared to simplified systems investigated in laboratory experiments. In this study, we quantified experimentally the competition between Pb2+, Co2+, Zn2+, and Mg2+ for specific adsorption on montmorillonite edge surfaces. Zn2+ was an effective competitor with Pb2+ and Co2+, and our results showed also unambiguously the influence of Mg2+ concentration levels on the specific adsorption of Pb2+ and Co2+. Because of the high ionic strength used in the experiments, cation exchange with Mg2+ was dismissed as a possible reason for such competition process, leaving specific competitive adsorption on edge surfaces as a unique explanation for our observations. Modeling of Pb2+ adsorption data with a state-of-art electrostatic complexation model for montmorillonite edge surfaces, supported by state-of-the-art, made it possible to distinguish two types of possible competition driving forces: Zn2+ competition for adsorption site occupancy but also detrimental changes in surface electrostatic potential following Mg2+ adsorption on sites neighboring those of Pb2+ adsorption. Mg2+ competition observed in our experiment should apply in most of clayey environments. Consequently, adsorption data obtained on pure clay mineral phases, and the associated models that have been built based on these data without considering the geochemical background in competitive species, may overestimate the retention properties of clay minerals when applied to natural settings.},

Besides microbial denitrification, abiotic nitrite reduction by Fe(II) (chemodenitrification) has the potential to be an important source of N               2               O. Here, using microcosms, we quantified N               2               O formation in coastal marine sediments under typical summer temperatures. Comparison between gamma-radiated and microbially-active microcosm experiments revealed that at least 15–25\% of total N               2               O formation was caused by chemodenitrification, whereas 75–85\% of total N               2               O was potentially produced by microbial N-transformation processes. An increase in (chemo)denitrification-based N               2               O formation and associated Fe(II) oxidation caused an upregulation of N               2               O reductase (typical               nosZ               ) genes and a distinct community shift to potential Fe(III)-reducers (               Arcobacter               ), Fe(II)-oxidizers (               Sulfurimonas               ), and nitrate/nitrite-reducing microorganisms (               Marinobacter               ).

Fresh samples were heated in air to temperatures between 155³C and 610³C. Goethite and hematite were the magnetically dominant phases after all runs except 500³C and 610³C, for which only hematite was found. However, partially dehydrated goethites after the 238\textasciicircum 402³C runs had broad peaks or inflections in the LTIM curves around 120 K, suggesting the formation of an intermediate spinel phase. These samples were next given a saturation remanence in a field of 2 T at 10 K and the remanence was measured continuously during zero-field warming to 300 K. There was a decrease in remanence at the Verwey transition (120 K), diagnostic of magnetite. The possible formation of a small amount of magnetite is of serious concern in studies of goethite-bearing sediments and rocks. Chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) of this strongly magnetic spinel phase could significantly modify the direction as well as the intensity of the original goethite CRM. As well, it would be a new source of paleomagnetic noise as far as primary remanence carried by other mineral phases is concerned. ß 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

It controls primary productivity in many parts of the global ocean, consequently playing a crucial role in the uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The marine N cycle is driven by multiple biogeochemical transformations mediated by microorganisms, including processes contributing to the marine fixed N pool (N2 fixation) and retained N pool (nitrification, assimilation, and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia), as well as processes contributing to the fixed N loss (denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation and nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation). The N cycle maintains the functioning of marine ecosystems and will be a crucial component in how the ocean responds to global environmental change. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the marine microbial N cycle, the ecology and distribution of the main functional players involved, and the main impacts of anthropogenic activities on the marine N cycle.},

Here, we explore prokaryotic diversity from the perspective of the GTDB and highlight the importance of metagenome-assembled genomes in expanding available genomic representation. We also discuss improvements to the GTDB website which allow tracking of taxonomic changes, easy assessment of genome assembly quality, and identification of genomes assembled from type material or used as species representatives. Methodological updates and policy changes made since the inception of the GTDB are then described along with the procedure used to update species clusters in the GTDB. We conclude with a discussion on the use of average nucleotide identities as a pragmatic approach for delineating prokaryotic species.},

From this uncontroversial idea, a self-consistent representation of the origin of life process is built up, which is based on the possibility of a series of intermediate stages. This approach requires a particular kind of stability for these stages—dynamic kinetic stability (DKS)—which is not usually observed in regular chemistry, and which is reflected in the persistence of entities capable of self-reproduction. The necessary connection of this kinetic behaviour with far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions is emphasized and this leads to an evolutionary view for the origin of life in which multiplying entities must be associated with the dissipation of free energy. Any kind of entity involved in this process has to pay the energetic cost of irreversibility, but, by doing so, the contingent emergence of new functions is made feasible. The consequences of these views on the studies of processes by which life can emerge are inferred.},

In this Perspective we describe the existence of a recently discovered non-equilibrium state of matter, an energized dynamic kinetic state, and demonstrate how particular chemical systems once activated into that kinetic state could manifest rudimentary cognitive behavior. Thus, contrary to a common view that biology is not reducible to physics and chemistry, recent findings in both chemistry and biology suggest that life’s mental state is an outcome of its physical state, and therefore may be explicable in physical/chemical terms. Such understanding offers added insight into the physico-chemical process by which life was able to emerge from non-life and the perennial ‘what is life?’ question. Most remarkably, it appears that Darwin, through his deep understanding of the evolutionary process, already sensed the existence of a connection between life’s physical and mental states.},

Given the modern scientific view that life emerged from non‐life, how was ‘dead’ matter able to take on mental capabilities? In this Review we report on two recent scientific discoveries, which together offer new insights into the possible physical basis of mind and the origin of ‘self’. First, recent thinking in microbiology now contends that simplest life manifests highly developed cognitive capabilities, suggesting that such capabilities were initiated early in the evolutionary process, likely within chemistry. Second, the recent discovery of a new dimension within chemical space of energized dynamic kinetically stable (DKS) chemical systems appears able to explain the emergence of systems with distinct non‐physical characteristics, including cognition and ‘self’. These two developments, when coupled to a physically based description of the evolutionary process, offer a feasible means of outlining the physical/chemical basis for life's mental state and a means for its emergence. A door toward resolution of the seemingly intractable ‘mind from matter’ problem may have opened up.},

  abstract = {The isoelectric point (IEP) of the edge surface of a montmorillonite sample was determined by using electrophoretic mobility measurements. This parameter, which is fundamental for the understanding of the charging behavior of clay mineral surfaces, was never measured so far because of the presence of permanent negative charges within the montmorillonite structure, charges that mask the electrokinetic behavior of the edges. The strategy was to block or neutralize the structural charges with two different cations, methylene blue (MB+) and tetraethylenepentaminecopper(II) ([Cu(tetren)]2+), so that the charging behavior of the particles becomes that of the edge surfaces. Adsorption isotherms of MB+ and [Cu(tetren)]2+ at different ionic strengths (NaCl) were performed to establish the uptakes that neutralize the cation exchange capacity (CEC, 0.96 meq g−1) of the sample. At high adsorptive concentrations, there was a superequivalent adsorption of MB+ (adsorption exceeding the CEC) and an equivalent adsorption of [Cu(tetren)]2+ (adsorption reaching the CEC). In both cases, structural charges were neutralized at uptakes very close to the CEC. Zeta potential (ζ) vs pH data at different ionic strengths of montmorillonite with adsorbed MB+ allowed to estimate an upper limit of the edge’s IEP, 5.3 ± 0.2. The same kind of data obtained with adsorbed [Cu(tetren)]2+ provided a lower limit of the IEP, 4.0 ± 0.2. These values are in agreement with previously informed IEP and point of zero charge of pyrophyllite, which is structurally analogous to montmorillonite but carries no permanent charges. The importance of knowing the IEP of the edge surface of clay minerals is discussed. This value characterizes the intrinsic reactivity of edges, that is, the protonating capacity of edge groups in absence of any electric field generated by structural charges. It also allows us to correct relative edge charge vs pH curves obtained by potentiometric titrations and to obtain the true edge charge vs pH curves at different electrolyte concentrations.},

  abstract = {Analyses of the complete genomes of sequenced denitrifying bacteria revealed that approximately 1/3 have a truncated denitrification pathway, lacking the nosZ gene encoding the nitrous oxide reductase. We investigated whether the number of denitrifiers lacking the genetic ability to synthesize the nitrous oxide reductase in soils is important for the proportion of N2O emitted by denitrification. Serial dilutions of the denitrifying strain Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 lacking the nosZ gene were inoculated into three different soils to modify the proportion of denitrifiers having the nitrous oxide reductase genes. The potential denitrification and N2O emissions increased when the size of inoculated C58 population in the soils was in the same range as the indigenous nosZ community. However, in two of the three soils, the increase in potential denitrification in inoculated microcosms compared with the noninoculated microcosms was higher than the increase in N2O emissions. This suggests that the indigenous denitrifier community was capable of acting as a sink for the N2O produced by A. tumefaciens. The relative amount of N2O emitted also increased in two soils with the number of inoculated C58 cells, establishing a direct causal link between the denitrifier community composition and potential N2O emissions by manipulating the proportion of denitrifiers having the nosZ gene. However, the number of denitrifiers which do not possess a nitrous oxide reductase might not be as important for N2O emissions in soils having a high N2O uptake capacity compared with those with lower. In conclusion, we provide a proof of principle that the inability of some denitrifiers to synthesize the nitrous oxide reductase can influence the nature of the denitrification end products, indicating that the extent of the reduction of N2O to N2 by the denitrifying community can have a genetic basis.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        ATP is universally conserved as the principal energy currency in cells, driving metabolism through phosphorylation and condensation reactions. Such deep conservation suggests that ATP arose at an early stage of biochemical evolution. Yet purine synthesis requires six phosphorylation steps linked to ATP hydrolysis. This autocatalytic requirement for ATP to synthesize ATP implies the need for an earlier prebiotic ATP-equivalent, which could drive protometabolism before purine synthesis. Why this early phosphorylating agent was replaced, and specifically with ATP rather than other nucleotide triphosphates, remains a mystery. Here we show that the deep conservation of ATP reflects its prebiotic chemistry in relation to another universally conserved intermediate, acetyl phosphate, which bridges between thioester and phosphate metabolism by linking acetyl CoA to the substrate-level phosphorylation of ADP. We confirm earlier results showing that acetyl phosphate can phosphorylate ADP to ATP at nearly 20 \% yield in water in the presence of Fe             3+             ions. We then show that Fe             3+             and acetyl phosphate are surprisingly favoured: a panel of other prebiotically relevant ions and minerals did not catalyze ADP phosphorylation; nor did a number of other potentially prebiotic phosphorylating agents. Only carbamoyl phosphate showed some modest phosphorylating activity. Critically, we show that acetyl phosphate does not phosphorylate other nucleotide diphosphates or free pyrophosphate in water. The phosphorylation of ADP monomers seems to be favoured by the interaction between the N6 amino group on the adenine ring with Fe             3+             coupled to acetyl phosphate. Our findings suggest that the reason ATP is universally conserved across life is that its formation is chemically favoured in aqueous solution under mild prebiotic conditions.},

The reaction proceeds mainly through racemic erythrose-2,4-phosphate, and terminates with a large fraction of racemic altrose-2,4,6-phosphate. In the absence of an inductive mineral phase, no detectable homogeneous reaction takes place in the concentration- and pH range used. The reactant glycolaldehydephosphate is practically completely sorbed within an hour from solutions with concentrations as low as 50 \#m; the half-time for conversion to hexose phosphates is of the order of two days at room temperature and pH 9.5. Total production of sugar phosphates in the mineral interlayer is largely independent of the glycolaldehyde phosphate concentration in the external solution, but is determined by the total amount of GAP offered for sorption up to the capacity of the mineral. In the presence of equimolar amounts of rac-glyceraldehyde-2-phosphate, but under otherwise similar conditions, aldopentose2,4,-diphosphates also form, but only as a small fraction of the hexose-2,4,6-phosphates.},

This material comprises a varied suite of soluble organic compounds that are similar, sometimes identical, to those found in the biosphere, such as amino acids, carboxylic acids, and sugar derivatives. Some amino acids of this suite also show L-enantiomeric excesses, and suggest the possibility they may have contributed to terrestrial homochirality by direct input of meteoritic material to the early Earth. This optical activity appears to be limited to the subgroup of α-methyl amino acids which, although not common in the extant biosphere, would have been well suited to provide the early earth with both enantiomeric excesses and means for their amplification by subsequent chemical evolution. We can also envision this exogenous delivery of carbonaceous material by meteorites and comets as having coincided with the endogenous formation of prebiotic precursors and influenced their evolution by complementary reactions or catalysis.},

On the estuary scale, denitrification accounted for \textasciitilde{} 90\% of the nitrogen reduction, followed by DNRA and anammox. However, the relative importance of these reactions to each other was not evenly distributed through the estuary. A Nitrogen Retention Index (NIRI) was calculated from the rate data (DNRA/(denitrification + anammox)) as a metric to assess the relative amounts of reactive nitrogen being recycled versus retained in the sediments following reduction. The distribution of rates and accompanying sediment geochemical analytes suggested variable controls on specific reactions, and on the NIRI, depending on position in the estuary and that these controls were linked to organic carbon abundance, organic carbon source, and pore water sulfide concentration. The relationship between NIRI and organic carbon abundance was dependent on organic carbon source. Sulfide proved the single best predictor of NIRI, accounting for 44\% of its observed variance throughout the whole estuary. We suggest that as a single metric, sulfide may have utility as a proxy for gauging the distribution of denitrification, anammox, and DNRA.},

Among the original proposals, minerals have been considered in: (a) processes that would discriminate molecular chirality; (b) condensation reactions of biomolecular precursors; (c) prebiotic catalysis; (d) biochemical templates; and (e) autocatalytic metabolism. In this communication it is emphazised the complex properties of both surface reactions and interfaces between minerals and aqueous solutions simulating Archean scenarios. The properties of pyrite surface net charge and of its interface with a solution simulating primitive seawater are discussed and their implications to the autocatalytic model (Wächtershäuser 1988a 1992) are presented in order to demonstrate their relevance. The proposed roles of iron-sulfide minerals (mainly pyrite) as physical support for primitive bidimensional metabolism and chiral discriminator (Wächtershäuser 1988a, Huber \& Wächtershäuser 1998) are revised. It is shown that: (a) the net surface charge can be modulated by the pyrite-aqueous solution interface; (b) mononucleotides attachment to pyrite require a cationic bridge; and (c) direct absorption of acetate - a molecule proposed as carbon source in primitive aqueous environments - also modulates the interface properties and would have masked pyrite’s bulk structure. These results indicate that physicochemical changes of mineral surfaces - caused by environments simulating Archean aqueous scenarios - should be taken into account in the proposals of mineral prebiotic roles.},

  abstract = {A variety of macromolecules and small molecules—(oligo)nucleotides, proteins, lipids and metabolites—are collectively considered essential to early life. However, previous schemes for the origin of life—e.g. the ‘RNA world’ hypothesis—have tended to assume the initial emergence of life based on one such molecular class followed by the sequential addition of the others, rather than the emergence of life based on a mixture of all the classes of molecules. This view is in part due to the perceived implausibility of multi-component reaction chemistry producing such a mixture. The concept of systems chemistry challenges such preconceptions by suggesting the possibility of molecular synergism in complex mixtures. If a systems chemistry method to make mixtures of all the classes of molecules considered essential for early life were to be discovered, the significant conceptual difficulties associated with pure RNA, protein, lipid or metabolism ‘worlds’ would be alleviated. Knowledge of the geochemical conditions conducive to the chemical origins of life is crucial, but cannot be inferred from a planetary sciences approach alone. Instead, insights from the organic reactivity of analytically accessible chemical subsystems can inform the search for the relevant geochemical conditions. If the common set of conditions under which these subsystems work productively, and compatibly, matches plausible geochemistry, an origins of life scenario can be inferred. Using chemical clues from multiple subsystems in this way is akin to triangulation, and constitutes a novel approach to discover the circumstances surrounding the transition from chemistry to biology. Here, we exemplify this strategy by finding common conditions under which chemical subsystems generate nucleotides and lipids in a compatible and potentially synergistic way. The conditions hint at a post-meteoritic impact origin of life scenario.},

Thus, it is important to extract, analyze, and interpret this abundance of information to improve our understanding of the planetary bodies in our solar system and the role our planet’s geosphere played in the origin and evolution of life. Over the past several decades, data-driven efforts in mineralogy have seen a gradual increase. The development and application of data science and analytics methods to mineralogy, while extremely promising, has also been somewhat ad hoc in nature. To systematize and synthesize the direction of these efforts, we introduce the concept of “Mineral Informatics,” which is the next frontier for researchers working with mineral data. In this paper, we present our vision for Mineral Informatics and the X-Informatics underpinnings that led to its conception, as well as the needs, challenges, opportunities, and future directions of the field. The intention of this paper is not to create a new specific field or a sub-field as a separate silo, but to document the needs of researchers studying minerals in various contexts and fields of study, to demonstrate how the systemization and enhanced access to mineralogical data will increase cross- and interdisciplinary studies, and how data science and informatics methods are a key next step in integrative mineralogical studies.},

This work calculates a semiempirical lifetime based on Microwave Limb Sounder satellite measurements of stratospheric profiles of nitrous oxide, ozone, and temperature; laboratory cross-section data for ozone and molecular oxygen plus kinetics for O(1D); the observed solar spectrum; and a simple radiative transfer model. The result is 116 ± 9 years. The observed monthly-to-biennial variations in lifetime and tropical abundance are well matched by four independent chemistry-transport models driven by reanalysis meteorological fields for the period of observation (2005–2010), but all these models overestimate the lifetime due to lower abundances in the critical loss region near 32 km in the tropics. These models plus a chemistry-climate model agree on the nitrous oxide feedback factor on its own lifetime of 0.94 ± 0.01, giving N2O perturbations an effective residence time of 109 years. Combining this new empirical lifetime with model estimates of residence time and preindustrial lifetime (123 years) adjusts our best estimates of the human-natural balance of emissions today and improves the accuracy of projected nitrous oxide increases over this century.},

  abstract = {Research on the origin of life is highly heterogeneous. After a peculiar historical development, it still includes strongly opposed views which potentially hinder progress. In the 1st Interdisciplinary Origin of Life Meeting, early-career researchers gathered to explore the commonalities between theories and approaches, critical divergence points, and expectations for the future. We find that even though classical approaches and theories—e.g., bottom-up and top-down, RNA world vs. metabolism-first—have been prevalent in origin of life research, they are ceasing to be mutually exclusive and they can and should feed integrating approaches. Here we focus on pressing questions and recent developments that bridge the classical disciplines and approaches, and highlight expectations for future endeavours in origin of life research.},

  abstract = {Application of physical and chemical concepts, complemented by studies of prokaryotes in ice cores and permafrost, has led to the present understanding of how microorganisms can metabolize at subfreezing temperatures on Earth and possibly on Mars and other cold planetary bodies. The habitats for life at subfreezing temperatures benefit from two unusual properties of ice. First, almost all ionic impurities are insoluble in the crystal structure of ice, which leads to a network of micron-diameter veins in which microorganisms may utilize ions for metabolism. Second, ice in contact with mineral surfaces develops a nanometrethick film of unfrozen water that provides a second habitat that may allow microorganisms to extract energy from redox reactions with ions in the water film or ions in the mineral structure. On the early Earth and on icy planets, prebiotic molecules in veins in ice may have polymerized to RNA and polypeptides by virtue of the low water activity and high rate of encounter with each other in nearly onedimensional trajectories in the veins. Prebiotic molecules may also have utilized grain surfaces to increase the rate of encounter and to exploit other physicochemical features of the surfaces.},

  abstract = {Temperature is a key variable in biological processes. However, a complete understanding of biological temperature adaptation is lacking, in part because of the unique constraints among different evolutionary lineages and physiological groups. Here we compared the genomes of cultivated psychrotolerant and thermotolerant methanogens, which are physiologically related and span growth temperatures from −2.5°C to 122°C. Despite being phylogenetically distributed amongst three phyla in the archaea, the genomic core of cultivated methanogens comprises about one-third of a given genome, while the genome fraction shared by any two organisms decreases with increasing phylogenetic distance between them. Increased methanogenic growth temperature is associated with reduced genome size, and thermotolerant organisms—which are distributed across the archaeal tree—have larger core genome fractions, suggesting that genome size is governed by temperature rather than phylogeny. Thermotolerant methanogens are enriched in metal and other transporters, and psychrotolerant methanogens are enriched in proteins related to structure and motility. Observed amino acid compositional differences between temperature groups include proteome charge, polarity and unfolding entropy. Our results suggest that in the methanogens, shared physiology maintains a large, conserved genomic core even across large phylogenetic distances and biology’s temperature extremes.},

  abstract = {The origin of life (OOL) problem remains one of the more challenging scientific questions of all time. In this essay, we propose that following recent experimental and theoretical advances in systems chemistry, the underlying principle governing the emergence of life on the Earth can in its broadest sense be specified, and may be stated as follows: all stable (persistent) replicating systems will tend to evolve over time towards systems of greater stability. The stability kind referred to, however, is dynamic kinetic stability, and quite distinct from the traditional thermodynamic stability which conventionally dominates physical and chemical thinking. Significantly, that stability kind is generally found to be enhanced by increasing complexification, since added features in the replicating system that improve replication efficiency will be reproduced, thereby offering an explanation for the emergence of life's extraordinary complexity. On the basis of that simple principle, a fundamental reassessment of the underlying chemistry–biology relationship is possible, one with broad ramifications. In the context of the OOL question, this novel perspective can assist in clarifying central ahistoric aspects of abiogenesis, as opposed to the many historic aspects that have probably been forever lost in the mists of time.},

More remarkably, through nature’s objective laws, chemical systems emerged and evolved to take advantage of those laws. Even more inexplicably, nature uncovered those laws twice—once unconsciously, once consciously. Accordingly, one could rephrase the origin of life question as follows: how was nature able to become self-aware and discover its own laws? What is the law of nature that enabled nature to discover its own laws? Addressing these challenging questions in physical-chemical terms may be possible through the newly emergent field of systems chemistry.},

Although fatty-acid-based vesicles are well studied, how they transitioned to phospholipid vesicles is uncertain. Herein, we show that cyclic-phospholipids formed from fatty acids and glycerol could have played a role by generating a heterogeneous library of vesicles with diverse morphologies and tolerance to a range of metal ions, temperature, and pH. The cyclic phosphate moiety facilitates the natural emergence of vesicles composed of diacyl-phospholipids to become part of the chemical evolutionary process. Competing emergent properties of the various systems (facilitated by additives) could have led to an early preference of the sn-1,2-acyl-substitution on the glycerol backbone coincidental with extant biology. Thus, cyclic-phospholipids could have played a significant role not only in early prebiotic protocellular chemistry but also in facilitating the chemical evolution of protocells from the structurally simple to the functionally more complex.},

We here discuss that because of niche adaptation, the evolutionary selection acting on the metabolic network structure distinguishes modern species and early life forms. Yet, its basic structure remained conserved over more than three billion years of diverging evolution. We speculate that this situation attributes key roles in metabolic network evolution to (i) the reaction properties of central metabolites, (ii) simple catalysts (e.g. metal ions, amino acids) whose importance remained unchanged during evolution, and (iii) the interconnectivity of the network that limits its expansion. The conservation of network structure hence implies that early life forms already used similar metabolic reaction topologies as modern species.},

The oldest well-preserved carbon occurs with fossil-like structures in 3.5-billion-year-old black chert. The carbonaceous matter, which is associated with hydrothermal chert-barite vent systems originating in underlying basaltic-komatiitic lavas, is thought to be derived from microbial life. Here, we show that 3.5-billion-year-old black chert vein systems from the Pilbara Craton, Australia contain abundant residues of migrated organic carbon. Using younger analogs, we argue that the black cherts formed during precipitation from silica-rich, carbon-bearing hydrothermal fluids in vein systems and vent-proximal seafloor sediments. Given the volcanic setting and lack of organic-rich sediments, we speculate that the vent-mound systems contain carbon derived from rock-powered organic synthesis in the underlying mafic-ultramafic lavas, providing a glimpse of a prebiotic world awash in terrestrial organic compounds.           ,              Hydrothermal silica-carbon precipitation in 3.5 Ga basalt-hosted vent systems point to contribution from abiotic carbon synthesis.},

Two research cruises were performed during June 2012 between the North Sea and Arctic Greenland and Barent Seas, and in January–February 2013 to the Antarctic Scotia Sea. Seven stations were occupied in all during which shipboard experimental manipulations of the carbonate chemistry were performed through additions of NaHCO3À þHCl in order to examine the impact of shortterm (48 h for N2O and between 96 and 168 h for AOA) exposure to control and elevated conditions of OA. During each experiment, triplicate incubations were performed at ambient conditions and at 3 lowered levels of pH which varied between 0.06 and 0.4 units according to the total scale and which were targeted at CO2 partial pressures of \$ 500, 750 and 1000 matm. The AOA assemblage in both Arctic and Antarctic regions was dominated by two major archetypes that represent the marine AOA clades most often detected in seawater. There were no significant changes in AOA assemblage composition between the beginning and end of the incubation experiments. N2O production was sensitive to decreasing pHT at all stations and decreased by between 2.4\% and 44\% with reduced pHT values of between 0.06 and 0.4. The reduction in N2O yield from nitrification was directly related to a decrease of between 28\% and 67\% in available NH3 as a result of the pH driven shift in the NH3:NH4 þ equilibrium.

Here we present experimental evidence of N               2               O removal under fully oxygenated conditions, coupled with observations of bacterial communities with novel, atypical gene sequences for N               2               O reduction. The focus of this work was on the high latitude Atlantic Ocean where we show bacterial consumption sufficient to account for oceanic N               2               O depletion and the occurrence of regional sinks for atmospheric N               2               O.},

  abstract = {The coastal ocean contributes to regulating atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations by taking up carbon dioxide (CO2) and releasing nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). In this second phase of the Regional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes (RECCAP2), we quantify global coastal ocean fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4 using an ensemble of global gap-filled observation-based products and ocean biogeochemical models. The global coastal ocean is a net sink of CO2 in both observational products and models, but the magnitude of the median net global coastal uptake is ∼60\% larger in models (−0.72 vs. −0.44 PgC year{$\mkern1mu$}−1, 1998–2018, coastal ocean extending to 300 km offshore or 1,000 m isobath with area of 77 million km{$\mkern1mu$}2). We attribute most of this model-product difference to the seasonality in sea surface CO2 partial pressure at mid- and high-latitudes, where models simulate stronger winter CO2 uptake. The coastal ocean CO2 sink has increased in the past decades but the available time-resolving observation-based products and models show large discrepancies in the magnitude of this increase. The global coastal ocean is a major source of N2O (+0.70 PgCO2-e year{$\mkern1mu$}−1 in observational product and +0.54 PgCO2-e year{$\mkern1mu$}−1 in model median) and CH4 (+0.21 PgCO2-e year{$\mkern1mu$}−1 in observational product), which offsets a substantial proportion of the coastal CO2 uptake in the net radiative balance (30\%–60\% in CO2-equivalents), highlighting the importance of considering the three greenhouse gases when examining the influence of the coastal ocean on climate.},

  abstract = {The origin of life on earth requires the synthesis of protobiopolymers in realistic geologic environments along strictly abiotic pathways that rely on inorganic phases (such as minerals) instead of cellular machinery to promote condensation. One such class of polymer central to biochemistry is the polynucleotides, and oligomerization of activated ribonucleotides has been widely studied. Nonetheless, the range of laboratory conditions tested to date is limited and the impact of realistic early Earth conditions on condensation reactions remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the potential for a variety of minerals to enhance oligomerization using ribonucleotide monomers as one example to model condensation under plausible planetary conditions. The results show that several minerals differing in both structure and composition enhance oligomerization. Sulfide minerals yielded oligomers of comparable lengths to those formed in the presence of clays, with galena being the most effective, yielding oligonucleotides up to six bases long. Montmorillonite continues to excel beyond other clays. Chemical pretreatment of the clay was not required, though maximum oligomer lengths decreased from \textasciitilde 11 to 6 bases. These results demonstrate the diversity of mineral phases that can impact condensation reactions and highlight the need for greater consideration of environmental context when assessing prebiotic synthesis and the origin of life.},

Here, we describe a prebiotically plausible environment that draws on the strengths of both scenarios: surface hydrothermal vents. We show how key feedstock molecules for prebiotic chemistry can be produced in abundance in shallow and surficial hydrothermal systems. We calculate the chemistry of volcanic gases feeding these vents over a range of pressures and basalt C/N/O contents. If ultra-reducing carbon-rich nitrogen-rich gases interact with subsurface water at a volcanic vent they result in 10−3–1 M concentrations of diacetylene (C4H2), acetylene (C2H2), cyanoacetylene (HC3N), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), bisulfite (likely in the form of salts containing HSO3 – ), hydrogen sulfide (HS – ) and soluble iron in vent water. One key feedstock molecule, cyanamide (CH2N2), is not formed in significant quantities within this scenario, suggesting that it may need to be delivered exogenously, or formed from hydrogen cyanide either via organometallic compounds, or by some as yet-unknown chemical synthesis. Given the likely ubiquity of surface hydrothermal vents on young, hot, terrestrial planets, these results identify a prebiotically plausible local geochemical environment, which is also amenable to future lab-based simulation.},

  abstract = {There is a consensus that the interaction of organic molecules with the surfaces of naturally-occurring minerals might have played a crucial role in chemical evolution and complexification in a prebiotic era. The hurdle of an overly diluted primordial soup occurring in the free ocean may have been overcome by the adsorption and concentration of relevant molecules on the surface of abundant minerals at the sea shore. Specific organic–mineral interactions could, at the same time, organize adsorbed molecules in well-defined orientations and activate them toward chemical reactions, bringing to an increase in chemical complexity. As experimental approaches cannot easily provide details at atomic resolution, the role of in silico computer simulations may fill that gap by providing structures and reactive energy profiles at the organic–mineral interface regions. Accordingly, numerous computational studies devoted to prebiotic chemical evolution induced by organic–mineral interactions have been proposed. The present article aims at reviewing recent in silico works, mainly focusing on prebiotic processes occurring on the mineral surfaces of clays, iron sulfides, titanium dioxide, and silica and silicates simulated through quantum mechanical methods based on the density functional theory (DFT). The DFT is the most accurate way in which chemists may address the behavior of the molecular world through large models mimicking chemical complexity. A perspective on possible future scenarios of research using in silico techniques is finally proposed.},

  abstract = {Eutrophication and stratification events have increased the incidences of hypoxia and anoxia in coastal environments. The depletion of oxygen in these environments can lead to a shift in biogeochemical processes such as denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). The balance between denitrification and DNRA is critical because denitrification leads to a loss of bioavailable nitrogen and DNRA maintains it within the system. This study examined the effects of reoxygenation on denitrification and DNRA in sediments collected from a periodically hypoxic system (Gippsland Lakes, Australia) and subjected to experimental hypoxia using a modified 15N-isotope pairing technique. For freshly collected sediments, the ratio of denitrification : DNRA was generally {$<$} 1 indicating a dominance of DNRA. After 3–4 weeks of oxygenation, denitrification increased relative to DNRA resulting in a denitrification : DNRA ratio {$>$} 1. Profiles of 15N-N2 and 15NHþ4 accumulation in these experiments showed denitrification and DNRA generally only took place in the surface \textasciitilde{} 2 cm of sediment. Prolonged experiments with reoxygenated sediments showed a decrease in the denitrification : DNRA to {$<$} 1 after 56 d coincident with deep accumulation of 15NHþ4 within the sediment (2–5 cm) suggesting faunal irrigation enhanced DNRA deep in the sediment. An experiment with bromide tracer confirmed the occurrence of DNRA deep within the sediment at 2–6 cm was coincident with tracer penetration, and there was a significant positive relationship between bioirrigation and DNRA. We suggest DNRA deep within the sediment was enhanced by increased availability of organic carbon, reduced solutes, and possibly exposure of reworked sediment to NOÀ3 .},

  abstract = {The general notion of an “RNA World” is that, in the early development of life on the Earth, genetic continuity was assured by the replication of RNA and genetically encoded proteins were not involved as catalysts. There is now strong evidence indicating that an RNA World did indeed exist before DNA- and protein-based life. However, arguments regarding whether life on Earth began with RNA are more tenuous. It might be imagined that all of the components of RNA were available in some prebiotic pool, and that these components assembled into replicating, evolving polynucleotides without the prior existence of any evolved macromolecules. A thorough consideration of this “RNA-first” view of the origin of life must reconcile concerns regarding the intractable mixtures that are obtained in experiments designed to simulate the chemistry of the primitive Earth. Perhaps these concerns will eventually be resolved, and recent experimental findings provide some reason for optimism. However, the problem of the origin of the RNA World is far from being solved, and it is fruitful to consider the alternative possibility that RNA was preceded by some other replicating, evolving molecule, just as DNA and proteins were preceded by RNA.},

The stricter of the safe or just boundaries sets the integrated safe and just ESB. Our findings show that justice considerations constrain the integrated ESBs more than safety considerations for climate and atmospheric aerosol loading. Seven of eight globally quantified safe and just ESBs and at least two regional safe and just ESBs in over half of global land area are already exceeded. We propose that our assessment provides a quantitative foundation for safeguarding the global commons for all people now and into the future.},

  abstract = {In recent years, an extension of the Darwinian framework is being considered for the study of prebiotic chemical evolution, shifting the attention from homogeneous populations of naked molecular species to populations of heterogeneous, compartmentalized and functionally integrated assemblies of molecules. Several implications of this shift of perspective are analysed in this critical review, both in terms of the individual units, which require an adequate characterization as self-maintaining systems with an internal organization, and also in relation to their collective and long-term evolutionary dynamics, based on competition, collaboration and selection processes among those complex individuals. On these lines, a concrete proposal for the set of molecular control mechanisms that must be coupled to bring about autonomous functional systems, at the interface between chemistry and biology, is provided.},

  abstract = {Not only have submarine hydrothermal systems been responsible for a variety of mineral deposits, they may also have contributed to the emergence of life in the Hadean. Sulfide deposits can be precipitated where metalbearing hydrothermal solutions invade bacteriogenic H2S-bearing wet sediments and the overlying seawater or brine. Similarly, life might be viewed as a complex organic product that emerged when and where hydrothermal H2 and other reduced chemical species reacted with CO2 and other mildly oxidized molecules dissolved in the Hadean ocean. Semipermeable and semiconducting FeS barriers or membranes would have precipitated spontaneously where H2 and HS–-bearing alkaline waters at ≤110°C seeped into the cool mildly acidic Fe-bearing Hadean ocean at a submarine hydrothermal mound on a ridge flank or on the deep ocean floor. The mound, consisting of Mg-rich clays, ephemeral carbonates, green rust, as well as the sulfides, acted as a natural, selfrestoring hydrothermal reactor. In particular, the sulfide barriers, composed of mackinawite and greigite, prevented the immediate titration of the two fluids and controlled their interactions. Metal sulfides were, and in tiny amounts are still, vital to all cells. Among other reactions they help catalyze the reduction of CO2 in autotrophic bacteria, including photosynthetic organisms. And the structure of greigite (NiFe5S8) is remarkably similar to the active sites (e.g., NiFe4S5) of the enzyme promoting the early metabolic pathway that generates acetate (CH3COO–) and H2O from CO2, H2, and a methyl group (-CH3). So clusters of greigite, sequestered in a simple organic envelope, could have acted as a protoenzyme, catalyzing the synthesis of acetate in the hydrothermal mound in the same way.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a reformulation of the submarine alkaline hydrothermal theory for the emergence of life in response to recent experimental findings. The theory views life, like other self-organizing systems in the Universe, as an inevitable outcome of particular disequilibria. In this case, the disequilibria were two: (1) in redox potential, between hydrogen plus methane with the circuit-completing electron acceptors such as nitrite, nitrate, ferric iron, and carbon dioxide, and (2) in pH gradient between an acidulous external ocean and an alkaline hydrothermal fluid. Both CO2 and CH4 were equally the ultimate sources of organic carbon, and the metal sulfides and oxyhydroxides acted as protoenzymatic catalysts. The realization, now 50 years old, that membrane-spanning gradients, rather than organic intermediates, play a vital role in life’s operations calls into question the idea of ‘‘prebiotic chemistry.’’ It informs our own suggestion that experimentation should look to the kind of nanoengines that must have been the precursors to molecular motors—such as pyrophosphate synthetase and the like driven by these gradients—that make life work. It is these putative free energy or disequilibria converters, presumably constructed from minerals comprising the earliest inorganic membranes, that, as obstacles to vectorial ionic flows, present themselves as the candidates for future experiments.

These include the formation of the planet and its geological structures, the formation of the first primitive chemicals, reaction, and assembly of these primitive chemicals to form more complex or functional products and assemblies, and finally the formation of the first cells (or protocells) on early Earth, which eventually evolved into modern cells. Each of these processes presumably occurred within specific prebiotic reaction environments, which could have been diverse in physical and chemical properties. While there are resources that describe prebiotically plausible environments or nutrient availability, here, we attempt to aggregate the literature for the various physicochemical properties of different prebiotic reaction microenvironments on early Earth. We introduce a handful of properties that can be quantified through physical or chemical techniques. The values for these physicochemical properties, if they are known, are then presented for each reaction environment, giving the reader a sense of the environmental variability of such properties. Such a resource may be useful for prebiotic chemists to understand the range of conditions in each reaction environment, or to select the medium most applicable for their targeted reaction of interest for exploratory studies.},

We furthermore demonstrate that sulfide released during thioester formation can be used in the synthesis of peptide bound [Fe–S] clusters, which like thioesters, are ancient components of metabolism. Together our results reveal a primordial linkage between high-energy ester formation and redox chemistry.},

Here, we elucidate base-catalyzed reaction mechanisms for the formation of diaminomaleonitrile and polyimine in liquid HCN using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Both materials are proposed as key intermediates for driving further chemical evolution. The formation of these materials is predicted to proceed at similar rates, thereby offering an explanation of how HCN’s self-reactions can diversify quickly under kinetic control. Knowledge of these reaction routes provides a basis for rationalizing subsequent reactivity in astrochemical environments such as on Saturn’s moon Titan, in the subsurface of comets, in exoplanet atmospheres, and on the early Earth.},

We discuss how it maps onto evolving planetary surface environments on early Earth and Mars and the value of comparative planetary evolution. The results indicate that Mars can offer direct evidence for geochemical conditions similar to prebiotic Earth, whose early record has been erased.

  abstract = {Nitrification is a two-step process linking the reduced and oxidized sides of the nitrogen cycle. These steps are typically tightly coupled with the primary intermediate, nitrite, rarely accumulating in coastal environments. Nitrite concentrations can exceed 10 μM during summer in estuarine waters adjacent to Sapelo Island, Georgia, U.S.A. Similar peaks at other locations have been attributed to decoupling of the two steps of nitrification by hypoxia; however, the waters around Sapelo Island are aerobic and wellmixed. Experiments examining the response to temperature shifts of a nitrifying assemblage composed of the same organisms found in the field indicate that ammonia- and nitrite-oxidation become uncoupled between 20 and 30 °C, leading to nitrite accumulation. This suggests that nitrite peaks in coastal waters might be explained by differences in the responses of ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizers to increased summer temperatures. Analysis of field data from 270 stations in 29 temperate and subtropical estuaries and lagoons show transient accumulation of nitrite driven primarily by water temperatures, rather than by hypoxia. Increased climate variability and warming coastal waters may therefore increase the frequency of these nitrite peaks, with potential ecosystem consequences that include increased N2O production, NO2− toxicity, and shifts in phytoplankton community composition.},

Approximately 9 TgN/yr may be accumulating in the terrestrial biosphere in pools with residence times of ten to several hundred years. Enhanced fluvial transport of nitrogen in rivers and percolation to groundwater accounts for ≈35 and 15 TgN/yr, respectively. Greater denitrification in terrestrial soils and wetlands may account for the loss of ≈17 TgN/yr from the land surface, calculated by a compilation of data on the fraction of N               2               O emitted to the atmosphere and the current global rise of this gas in the atmosphere.

The total of these enhanced sinks, 124 TgN/yr, is less than the human-enhanced inputs to the land surface, indicating areas of needed additional attention to global nitrogen biogeochemistry. Policy makers should focus on increasing nitrogen-use efficiency in fertilization, reducing transport of reactive N to rivers and groundwater, and maximizing denitrification to its N               2               endproduct.},

The Rickettsiales are an alphaproteobacterial order of obligate endosymbionts and parasites that infect a wide variety of eukaryotic hosts, including humans, livestock, insects and protists. Induced by their host-associated lifestyle, Rickettsiales genomes have undergone reductive evolution, leading to small, AT-rich genomes with limited metabolic capacities. Here we uncover eleven deep-branching alphaproteobacterial metagenome assembled genomes from aquatic environments, including data from the               Tara               Oceans initiative and other publicly available datasets, distributed over three previously undescribed Rickettsiales-related clades. Phylogenomic analyses reveal that two of these clades, Mitibacteraceae and Athabascaceae, branch sister to all previously sampled Rickettsiales. The third clade, Gamibacteraceae, branch sister to the recently identified ectosymbiotic ‘               Candidatus               Deianiraea vastatrix’. Comparative analyses indicate that the gene complement of Mitibacteraceae and Athabascaceae is reminiscent of that of free-living and biofilm-associated bacteria. Ancestral genome content reconstruction across the Rickettsiales species tree further suggests that the evolution of host association in Rickettsiales was a gradual process that may have involved the repurposing of a type IV secretion system.},

The results of new experiments lead to the following conclusions: The formose reaction is a geochemically plausible reaction which depends on neither basic conditions nor on the presence of trace amounts of carbohydrate impurities. However, this process is not a plausible source of ribose nor of any other individual sugar. In contrast to the nonspecific formation of complex mixtures of sugars via the formose reaction, the reduced sugar pentaerythritol is formed with great selectivity by the ultraviolet irradiation of 0.1 M formaldehyde. This compound may have played an important role in chemical evolution.},

Denitrification and N2O accumulation were determined by anaerobic incubations with and without C2H2, respectively. Denitrifying activities in the sediment suspensions of both lakes decreased markedly at an H2S concentration of 3 mg S lÿ1, whereas N2O accumulations in the sediment suspensions of Lakes Shinji and Nakaumi were highest at 75e100 mg S lÿ1 and 15e50 mg S lÿ1 H2S, respectively. In addition, H2S had marked inhibiting (about 30 h) and retarding effects on N2O reduction in the suspensions of both lakes. Two strains of halophilic N2O producers were isolated from the sediment of Lake Shinji (Aeromonas sp. and Vibrio sp.). N2O accumulation rates by Aeromonas sp. and Vibrio sp. were accelerated at 1e5 mg S lÿ1 and 1e10 mg S lÿ1 H2S, respectively. Patterns of inorganic nitrogen compounds after the incubations revealed the accumulation of NH4þ and NO2ÿ, with concomitant N2O, were accelerated by H2S. These results indicate that H2S plays a key role in regulation of N2O accumulation in the eutrophic estuarine or coastal sediments. Furthermore, the accumulation of N2O in the sediments of Lakes Shinji and Nakaumi is predicted to derive through dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) not only denitrification in the presence of H2S.},

  abstract = {Lateral lipid heterogeneity (i.e., raft formation) in biomembranes plays a functional role in living cells. Three-component mixtures of low- and high-melting lipids plus cholesterol offer a simplified experimental model for raft domains in which a liquid-disordered (Ld) phase coexists with a liquid-ordered (Lo) phase. Using such models, we recently showed that cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can detect phase separation in lipid vesicles based on differences in bilayer thickness. However, the considerable noise within cryo-EM data poses a significant challenge for accurately determining the membrane phase state at high spatial resolution. To this end, we have developed an image processing pipeline that utilizes machine learning (ML) to predict the bilayer phase in projection images of lipid vesicles. Importantly, the ML method exploits differences in both the thickness and molecular density of Lo compared to Ld, which leads to improved phase identification. To assess accuracy, we used artificial images of phase-separated lipid vesicles generated from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of Lo and Ld phases. Synthetic ground truth datasets mimicking a series of compositions along a tieline of Ld+Lo coexistence were created and then analyzed with various ML models. For all tieline compositions, we find that the ML approach can correctly identify the bilayer phase at 5 nm lateral resolution with {$>$} 90\% accuracy, thus providing a means to isolate the intensity profiles of coexisting Ld and Lo phases, as well as accurately determine domain size distributions, number of domains, and phase area fractions. The method described here provides a framework for characterizing nanoscopic lateral heterogeneities in membranes and paves the way for a more detailed understanding of raft properties in biological contexts.},

Here, we find that 3515 (18.11\%) IQ-TREE-inferred and 1813 (9.34\%) RAxML-NG-inferred maximum likelihood (ML) gene trees are topologically irreproducible when executing two replicates (Run1 and Run2) for each of 19,414 gene alignments in 15 animal, plant, and fungal phylogenomic datasets. Notably, coalescent-based ASTRAL species phylogenies inferred from Run1 and Run2 sets of individual gene trees are topologically irreproducible for 9/15 phylogenomic datasets, whereas concatenation-based phylogenies inferred twice from the same supermatrix are reproducible. Our simulations further show that irreproducible phylogenies are more likely to be incorrect than reproducible phylogenies. These results suggest that a considerable fraction of single-gene ML trees may be irreproducible. Increasing reproducibility in ML inference will benefit from providing analyses’ log files, which contain typically reported parameters (e.g., program, substitution model, number of tree searches) but also typically unreported ones (e.g., random starting seed number, number of threads, processor type).},

  abstract = {The effect of the nature of an initiator on the kinetics of formaldehyde consumption and on product composition in the Butlerov reaction was studied in a stirred flow reactor and a batch reactor. It was found that, under flow conditions, the kinetics and the product composition of this reaction are independent of the nature of the initiator. The reaction schemes proposed previously for an autocatalytic process mechanism based on the formation of glycolaldehyde from two formaldehyde molecules are incorrect. A correlation between the initiating activities of various monosaccharides and the rates of their conversion into an enediol form was found with the use of a batch reactor. Solid enediol complexes with Ca2+ ions were isolated for glucose, fructose, ribose, and sorbose; the initiating activity of these complexes was found to be much higher than the initiating activity of pure monosaccharides. A self-consistent mechanism was proposed for Butlerov reaction initiation. The formation of the enediol forms of monosaccharides followed by degradation to lower carbohydrates plays a key role in this mechanism. In turn, the initiating activity depends on the position of the carbonyl group in the monosaccharide molecule. The condensation reactions of glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, and dihydroxyacetone with each other were studied. Based on data on the condensation products of lower carbohydrates, a scheme was proposed for the Butlerov reaction. According to this reaction scheme, C2 and C3 carbohydrates mainly undergo an aldol condensation reaction with formaldehyde, whereas the formation of higher monosaccharides occurs by the aldol condensation of lower C2–C3 carbohydrates with each other.},

  abstract = {Pelagic marine Thaumarchaea play a primary role in ammonia oxidation, an integral part of nitrification and the nitrogen cycle. This study examines how physicochemical and biological variables influence rates of nitrification and the distribution, abundance and activity of ammonia oxidizers throughout the dark northeast Pacific Ocean. Nitrification rates are highest near the epipelagic-upper mesopelagic transition and decrease with depth according to a Martin-like power function, suggestive of a coupling to the organic matter flux. In contrast, archaeal and bacterial ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene abundance remains fairly constant throughout the upper mesopelagic. Density-based composites reveal nitrification to be highest in the upper pycnocline, within the nitrate:silica and ammonium maxima, while ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) abundances are highest in the lower pycnocline. Water column group A (WCA) and B (WCB) AOA amoA genes are present throughout the dark ocean but have no relationship to nitrification rates. WCA comprise the majority of the AOA community above 200 m and WCB comprise the majority of it below 500 m, largely because WCA abundances decrease precipitously from 200 m to 500 m. WCA and WCB amoA genes are actively transcribed throughout the dark ocean, irrespective of conditions. Thaumarchaeal urease (ureC) genes are also present throughout, implying a widespread capacity for mixotrophy; however, unlike amoA, their expression is not detectable. Together, the results support a strong linkage between organic matter flux and nitrification rates, identify density as an important control over AOA distributions, and suggest that WCA and WCB distributions are influenced by the availability of their preferred substrates in the dark ocean.},

  abstract = {Membrane bioenergetics are universal, yet the phospholipid membranes of archaea and bacteria—the deepest branches in the tree of life—are fundamentally different. This deep divergence in membrane chemistry is reflected in other stark differences between the two domains, including ion pumping and DNA replication. We resolve this paradox by considering the energy requirements of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). We develop a mathematical model based on the premise that LUCA depended on natural proton gradients. Our analysis shows that such gradients can power carbon and energy metabolism, but only in leaky cells with a proton permeability equivalent to fatty acid vesicles. Membranes with lower permeability (equivalent to modern phospholipids) collapse free-energy availability, precluding exploitation of natural gradients. Pumping protons across leaky membranes offers no advantage, even when permeability is decreased 1,000-fold. We hypothesize that a sodium-proton antiporter (SPAP) provided the first step towards modern membranes. SPAP increases the free energy available from natural proton gradients by ,60\%, enabling survival in 50-fold lower gradients, thereby facilitating ecological spread and divergence. Critically, SPAP also provides a steadily amplifying advantage to proton pumping as membrane permeability falls, for the first time favoring the evolution of ion-tight phospholipid membranes. The phospholipids of archaea and bacteria incorporate different stereoisomers of glycerol phosphate. We conclude that the enzymes involved took these alternatives by chance in independent populations that had already evolved distinct ion pumps. Our model offers a quantitatively robust explanation for why membrane bioenergetics are universal, yet ion pumps and phospholipid membranes arose later and independently in separate populations. Our findings elucidate the paradox that archaea and bacteria share DNA transcription, ribosomal translation, and ATP synthase, yet differ in equally fundamental traits that depend on the membrane, including DNA replication.},

In contrast, alkaline hydrothermal vents offer conditions similar to those harnessed by modern autotrophs, but there has been limited experimental evidence that such conditions could drive prebiotic chemistry. In the Hadean, in the absence of oxygen, alkaline vents are proposed to have acted as electrochemical flow reactors, in which alkaline fluids saturated in H2 mixed with relatively acidic ocean waters rich in CO2, through a labyrinth of interconnected micropores with thin inorganic walls containing catalytic Fe(Ni)S minerals. The difference in pH across these thin barriers produced natural proton gradients with equivalent magnitude and polarity to the proton-motive force required for carbon fixation in extant bacteria and archaea. How such gradients could have powered carbon reduction or energy flux before the advent of organic protocells with genes and proteins is unknown. Work over the last decade suggests several possible hypotheses that are currently being tested in laboratory experiments, field observations, and phylogenetic reconstructions of ancestral metabolism. We analyze the perplexing differences in carbon and energy metabolism in methanogenic archaea and acetogenic bacteria to propose a possible ancestral mechanism of CO2 reduction in alkaline hydrothermal vents. Based on this mechanism, we show that the evolution of active ion pumping could have driven the deep divergence of bacteria and archaea.

  abstract = {Archaeal diversity and evolution                            Archaea are prokaryotes that make up a third branch of the tree of life. Knowledge of archaeal biological diversity and their role in evolution has rapidly expanded in the past decade. Despite the discovery of previously unknown groups and lineages, few lineages have been well studied. Spang               et al.               review the diversity of Archaea and their genomes, metabolomes, and history, which clarifies the biology and placement of recently discovered archaeal lineages.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaaf3883                        ,                             BACKGROUND               Archaea have been recognized as a major domain of life besides Bacteria and Eukarya for about 40 years. Much of the pioneering research on archaeal organisms was dedicated to studying cellular machineries governing basal cellular processes such as transcription and translation and on elucidating physiological characteristics of the few archaeal strains that could be cultured. Although environmental surveys had started to reveal a plethora of uncultured archaeal lineages during the 1990s, in-depth knowledge about their diversity, ecology, and evolution remained limited. Recent developments in the field of metagenomics and single-cell genomics, however, have allowed the reconstruction of archaeal genomes directly from environmental samples without prior cultivation. Altogether, the use of these cultivation-independent approaches has led to the discovery of a multitude of previously unidentified archaeal lineages, some of which represent completely new branches in the archaeal tree. In this Review, we provide an overview of the currently recognized archaeal diversity, summarize new findings on the metabolic potential of recently described archaeal lineages, and discuss these data in light of archaeal evolution.                                         ADVANCES               Up until about a decade ago, all archaea were assigned to one of two major clades: the Crenarchaeota, which mostly comprise extreme thermophiles, or the Euryarchaeota, which mainly included methanogens and halophiles. Since then, our knowledge on archaeal diversity has increased rapidly. Now, Archaea include at least four major supergroups, the Euryarchaeota and the TACK, Asgard, and DPANN archaea, all of which comprise several different, potentially phylum-rank clades (see the figure). The lineages of these groups are not restricted to extreme habitats, as was once thought common for archaeal species; rather, archaea are widespread and occur in all thinkable environments on Earth, where they can make up substantial portions of the microbial biomass.               In line with their vast diversity, comparative genomics analyses reveal that Archaea are metabolically versatile and are characterized by different lifestyles. Recently discovered archaeal lineages include mesophiles and (hyper-)thermophiles, anaerobes and aerobes, autotrophs and heterotrophs, a large diversity of putative archaeal symbionts, as well as previously unknown acetogens and different groups of methanogens (see the figure). In fact, both the genetic potential to use the ancient Wood-Ljungdahl carbon fixation pathway and indications for methanogenic traits as well as the ability to anaerobically oxidize methane and other short hydrocarbons have now been found in various lineages outside the Euryarchaeota—the phylum comprising traditional methanogens and methane oxidizers. So far, little is known about the actual physiology of these archaea in their environmental niches or about their potential syntrophic relationships with other organisms, but recent findings highlight the importance and wide occurrence of these metabolic regimes in a wide diversity of archaea from anaerobic environments. Furthermore, these findings support hypotheses that suggest that all extant archaea evolved from an anaerobic autotrophic ancestor that used the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and may have been able to obtain energy through methanogenesis.               Last, the investigation of informational processing and cellular machineries have revealed that genomes of Asgard archaea, which affiliate with eukaryotes in the tree of life (see the figure), encode proteins that they only share with eukaryotes. Excitingly, these proteins are functionally enriched for membrane bending, vesicular biogenesis, and trafficking activities, suggesting that eukaryotes evolved from an archaeal host that contained some key components that governed the emergence of eukaryotic cellular complexity after endosymbiosis. It will be exciting to determine the function of these proteins, which may be involved in species-species interactions in extant members of the Asgard archaea.                                         OUTLOOK               The wealth of novel archaeal genomic data represents a treasure trove for generating testable hypotheses on the metabolic and cellular features of these archaea and will thus help to unveil their thus far poorly characterized biology. Recent findings emphasize the importance of investigating members of the archaeal domain of life in order to obtain a more comprehensive view of microbial ecology, symbiosis, and metabolic interdependencies involving archaeal partners, and of evolution of life on Earth in regard to the deep roots of archaea as well as our microbial ancestry.                                                   The archaeal tree of life.                   Schematic phylogenetic tree including major archaeal groups for which genomic data are currently available. The currently recognized groups include the Euryarchaeota (green branches) and the TACK, Asgard, and DPANN archaea (tan, yellow, and pink branches, respectively). Eukaryotes (gray branch) are suggested to have emerged from the Asgard archaea upon endosymbiosis with an alphaproteobacterial partner (the mitochondrial endosymbiont). For each archaeal lineage, key characteristics regarding metabolism and lifestyle are depicted.                                                                         ,              About 40 years ago, Archaea were recognized as a major prokaryotic domain of life besides Bacteria. Recently, cultivation-independent sequencing methods have produced a wealth of genomic data for previously unidentified archaeal lineages, several of which appear to represent newly revealed branches in the tree of life. Analyses of some recently obtained genomes have uncovered previously unknown metabolic traits and provided insights into the evolution of archaea and their relationship to eukaryotes. On the basis of our current understanding, much archaeal diversity still defies genomic exploration. Efforts to obtain and study genomes and enrichment cultures of uncultivated microbial lineages will likely further expand our knowledge about archaeal phylogenetic and metabolic diversity and their cell biology and ecological function.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            The alphaproteobacterium               Nitrobacter winogradskyi               (ATCC 25391) is a gram-negative facultative chemolithoautotroph capable of extracting energy from the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate. Sequencing and analysis of its genome revealed a single circular chromosome of 3,402,093 bp encoding 3,143 predicted proteins. There were extensive similarities to genes in two alphaproteobacteria,               Bradyrhizobium japonicum               USDA110 (1,300 genes) and               Rhodopseudomonas palustris               CGA009 CG (815 genes). Genes encoding pathways for known modes of chemolithotrophic and chemoorganotrophic growth were identified. Genes encoding multiple enzymes involved in anapleurotic reactions centered on C               2               to C               4               metabolism, including a glyoxylate bypass, were annotated. The inability of               N. winogradskyi               to grow on C               6               molecules is consistent with the genome sequence, which lacks genes for complete Embden-Meyerhof and Entner-Doudoroff pathways, and active uptake of sugars. Two gene copies of the nitrite oxidoreductase, type I ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, cytochrome               c               oxidase, and gene homologs encoding an aerobic-type carbon monoxide dehydrogenase were present. Similarity of nitrite oxidoreductases to respiratory nitrate reductases was confirmed. Approximately 10\% of the               N. winogradskyi               genome codes for genes involved in transport and secretion, including the presence of transporters for various organic-nitrogen molecules. The               N. winogradskyi               genome provides new insight into the phylogenetic identity and physiological capabilities of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria. The genome will serve as a model to study the cellular and molecular processes that control nitrite oxidation and its interaction with other nitrogen-cycling processes.},

  abstract = {Many decades of experimental and theoretical research on the origin of life have yielded important discoveries regarding the chemical and physical conditions under which organic compounds can be synthesized and polymerized. However, such conditions often seem mutually exclusive, because they are rarely encountered in a single environmental setting. As such, no convincing models explain how living cells formed from abiotic constituents. Here, we propose a new approach that considers the origin of life within the global context of the Hadean Earth. We review previous ideas and synthesize them in four central hypotheses: (i) Multiple microenvironments contributed to the building blocks of life, and these niches were not necessarily inhabitable by the first organisms; (ii) Mineral catalysts were the backbone of prebiotic reaction networks that led to modern metabolism; (iii) Multiple local and global transport processes were essential for linking reactions occurring in separate locations; (iv) Global diversity and local selection of reactants and products provided mechanisms for the generation of most of the diverse building blocks necessary for life. We conclude that no single environmental setting can offer enough chemical and physical diversity for life to originate. Instead, any plausible model for the origin of life must acknowledge the geological complexity and diversity of the Hadean Earth. Future research may therefore benefit from identifying further linkages between organic precursors, minerals, and fluids in various environmental contexts.},

  abstract = {Nitrite oxidation is an essential step in transformations of fixed nitrogen. The physiology of nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) implies that the rates of nitrite oxidation should be controlled by concentration of their substrate, nitrite, and the terminal electron acceptor, oxygen. The sensitivities of nitrite oxidation to oxygen and nitrite concentrations were investigated using 15N tracer incubations in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific. Nitrite stimulated nitrite oxidation under low in situ nitrite conditions, following Michaelis-Menten kinetics, indicating that nitrite was the limiting substrate. The nitrite half-saturation constant (Ks = 0.254 ± 0.161 μM) was 1–3 orders of magnitude lower than in cultivated NOB, indicating higher affinity of marine NOB for nitrite. The highest rates of nitrite oxidation were measured in the oxygen depleted zone (ODZ), and were partially inhibited by additions of oxygen. This oxygen sensitivity suggests that ODZ specialist NOB, adapted to low-oxygen conditions, are responsible for apparently anaerobic nitrite oxidation. Plain Language Summary Nitrite is a key intermediate in the biogeochemistry of low-oxygen marine environments, including the loss of fixed nitrogen as dinitrogen gas and nitrous oxide. Nitrate reduction to nitrite coupled to reoxidation of nitrite to nitrate has been proposed as a cycle that can preserve bioavailable nitrogen in oxygen minimum zones. This cycle implies that nitrite oxidation occurs in the absence, or near absence, of oxygen. Nitrite oxidation is considered to be an obligately aerobic process, although it has been reported from anoxic waters. Here we report on the regulation of nitrite oxidation by oxygen and nitrite in natural assemblages from the oxygen minimum zone of the Eastern Tropical North Pacific. We show that natural assemblages have very high affinity for nitrite and that oxygen actually inhibits nitrite oxidation in anoxic samples. These findings have implications for the marine nitrogen budget now and in future scenarios of changing ocean conditions.},

  abstract = {Significance             We show that materials with different structure and function can emerge from the same starting materials under different environmental conditions, such as order of reactant addition or inclusion of minerals. The discoveries we report were made possible by using analytical tools more common in omics/systems biology for functional and structural characterization, retasked for exploring and manipulating complex reaction networks. We not only demonstrate that environments can differentiate fixed sets of starting materials (both mixtures of pure amino acids and the classic Miller–Urey “prebiotic soup” model), but that this has functional consequences. It has been often said that biology is “chemistry with history” and this work shows how this process can start.           ,              Many approaches to the origin of life focus on how the molecules found in biology might be made in the absence of biological processes, from the simplest plausible starting materials. Another approach could be to view the emergence of the chemistry of biology as process whereby the environment effectively directs “primordial soups” toward structure, function, and genetic systems over time. This does not require the molecules found in biology today to be made initially, and leads to the hypothesis that environment can direct chemical soups toward order, and eventually living systems. Herein, we show how unconstrained condensation reactions can be steered by changes in the reaction environment, such as order of reactant addition, and addition of salts or minerals. Using omics techniques to survey the resulting chemical ensembles we demonstrate there are distinct, significant, and reproducible differences between the product mixtures. Furthermore, we observe that these differences in composition have consequences, manifested in clearly different structural and functional properties. We demonstrate that simple variations in environmental parameters lead to differentiation of distinct chemical ensembles from both amino acid mixtures and a primordial soup model. We show that the synthetic complexity emerging from such unconstrained reactions is not as intractable as often suggested, when viewed through a chemically agnostic lens. An open approach to complexity can generate compositional, structural, and functional diversity from fixed sets of simple starting materials, suggesting that differentiation of chemical ensembles can occur in the wider environment without the need for biological machinery.},

  abstract = {Understanding how life on Earth might have originated is the major goal of origins of life chemistry. To proceed from simple feedstock molecules and energy sources to a living system requires extensive synthesis and coordinated assembly to occur over numerous steps, which are governed only by environmental factors and inherent chemical reactivity. Demonstrating such a process in the laboratory would show how life can start from the inanimate. If the starting materials were irrefutably primordial and the end result happened to bear an uncanny resemblance to extant biology — for what turned out to be purely chemical reasons, albeit elegantly subtle ones — then it could be a recapitulation of the way that natural life originated. We are not yet close to achieving this end, but recent results suggest that we may have nearly finished the first phase: the beginning.},

Here, we propose that metabolic innovations accessible through the addition of a single reaction serve as stepping stones towards the later establishment of complex metabolic features in another environment. We demonstrate the feasibility of this hypothesis through three complementary analyses. First, using genome-scale metabolic modelling, we show that complex metabolic innovations in               Escherichia coli               can arise via changing nutrient conditions. Second, using phylogenetic approaches, we demonstrate that the acquisition patterns of complex metabolic pathways during the evolutionary history of bacterial genomes support the hypothesis. Third, we show how adaptation of laboratory populations of               E. coli               to one carbon source facilitates the later adaptation to another carbon source. Our work demonstrates how complex innovations can evolve through series of adaptive steps without the need to invoke non-adaptive processes.},

We compare their merits and their ability to quantify the role of transfers, and assess the impact of taxonomic sampling on their inferences.

  abstract = {The discovery of the Archaea is a major scientific hallmark of the twentieth century. Since then, important features of their cell biology, physiology, ecology, and diversity have been revealed. Over the course of some 40 years, the diversity of known archaea has expanded from 2 to about 30 phyla comprising over 20,000 species. Most of this archaeal diversity has been revealed by environmental 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing surveys using a broad range of universal and targeted primers. Of the few primers that target a large fraction of known archaeal diversity, all display a bias against recently discovered lineages, which limits studies aiming to survey overall archaeal diversity. Induced by genomic exploration of archaeal diversity, and improved phylogenomics approaches, archaeal taxonomic classification has been frequently revised. Due to computational limitations and continued discovery of new lineages, a stable archaeal phylogeny is not yet within reach. Obtaining phylogenetic and taxonomic consensus of archaea should be a high priority for the archaeal research community.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Our knowledge of archaeal diversity and evolution has expanded rapidly in the past decade. However, hardly any genomes of the phylum Korarchaeota have been obtained due to the difficulty in accessing their natural habitats and – possibly – their limited abundance. As a result, many aspects of Korarchaeota biology, physiology and evolution remain enigmatic. Here, we expand this phylum with five high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes. This improved taxon sampling combined with sophisticated phylogenomic analyses robustly places Korarchaeota at the base of TACK and Asgard clades, revisiting the phylum’s long-assumed position. Furthermore, we observe a clear split between terrestrial and marine thermal clades. Gene tree-aware ancestral reconstructions suggest that the last Korarchaeota common ancestor was a thermophilic autotroph. In contrast, Korarchaeaceae, the lineage where environmental transitions occurred, shifted towards a heterotrophic lifestyle. Terrestrial Korarchaeota gained many             cas             and CARF genes indicating they may need to manage viral infections. Together, our study provides new insights into these early diverging Archaea and suggests that gradual gene gain and loss shaped their adaptation to different thermal environments.                                   Importance             Korarchaeota are an ancient group of archaea, but their biology, physiology and evolution have remained obscure. Analysis of five novel Korarchaeota MAGs, and publicly available reference data provides robust phylogenomic evidence that Korarchaeota are placed at the base of Asgard archaea and TACK, revisiting the phylum’s long-assumed position. Gene content reconstruction suggests a versatile thermophilic and autotrophic last Korarchaeota common ancestor. Environmental distribution surveying of public databases places all Korarchaeota in thermophilic environments and indicates that their habitat is limited to hydrothermal vents and hot springs. Our modeling indicates at least two transitions linked to habitat switching between these environments in the evolutionary history of Korarchaeota. Both are linked to a significant alteration of the inferred ancestral gene content, including a shift towards a heterotrophic and potential scavenging lifestyle. Furthermore, hot spring Korarchaeota acquired various genes participating in resistance to viruses, suggesting they may need to manage frequent viral threats.},

  abstract = {Sedimentary denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) are two microbially-mediated ni­ trogen removal pathways with distinct climatic feedbacks. Estuaries receive large fluxes of anthropogenic ni­ trogen and serve as hotspots for nitrogen loss. Applying 15N isotope pairing technique and sediment intact core incubation in two subtropical estuaries, the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE) and Jiulong River Estuary (JRE), we show that denitrification predominates the sedimentary nitrogen loss with a minor contribution (8.6 ± 7.5\%) from anammox. Particulate organic matter degradation sustains the sedimentary nitrogen removal linking the nitrogen transformations between water column and sediment. Our results indicate that estuarine sediments exhibit high areal nitrogen removal rate, but play a relatively weak role in eliminating the nitrogen inputted from river basin due to the limited area. The riverine excess nitrogen will eventually enter into the adjacent conti­ nental shelf and be removed via phytoplankton assimilation-sedimentation-degradation-coupled nitrificationdenitrification. In addition, sedimentary denitrification causes 1.8 ± 2.2\% of nitrogen flow towards nitrous oxide (N2O) production and the derived N2O release flux accounts for 59\% and 65\% of the daily sea-air N2O emission in the YRE and JRE, respectively. These findings contribute to a better understanding of estuarine sedimentary nitrogen removal and associated climate feedbacks, and to the parameterization of Earth system models.},

  abstract = {Background: The availability of multiple, essentially complete genome sequences of prokaryotes and eukaryotes spurred both the demand and the opportunity for the construction of an evolutionary classification of genes from these genomes. Such a classification system based on orthologous relationships between genes appears to be a natural framework for comparative genomics and should facilitate both functional annotation of genomes and large-scale evolutionary studies. Results: We describe here a major update of the previously developed system for delineation of Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COGs) from the sequenced genomes of prokaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes and the construction of clusters of predicted orthologs for 7 eukaryotic genomes, which we named KOGs after eukaryotic orthologous groups. The COG collection currently consists of 138,458 proteins, which form 4873 COGs and comprise 75\% of the 185,505 (predicted) proteins encoded in 66 genomes of unicellular organisms. The eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs) include proteins from 7 eukaryotic genomes: three animals (the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens), one plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, two fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe), and the intracellular microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi. The current KOG set consists of 4852 clusters of orthologs, which include 59,838 proteins, or \textasciitilde 54\% of the analyzed eukaryotic 110,655 gene products. Compared to the coverage of the prokaryotic genomes with COGs, a considerably smaller fraction of eukaryotic genes could be included into the KOGs; addition of new eukaryotic genomes is expected to result in substantial increase in the coverage of eukaryotic genomes with KOGs. Examination of the phyletic patterns of KOGs reveals a conserved core represented in all analyzed species and consisting of \textasciitilde 20\% of the KOG set. This conserved portion of the KOG set is much greater than the ubiquitous portion of the COG set (\textasciitilde 1\% of the COGs). In part, this difference is probably due to the small number of included eukaryotic genomes, but it could also reflect the relative compactness of eukaryotes as a clade and the greater evolutionary stability of eukaryotic genomes. Conclusion: The updated collection of orthologous protein sets for prokaryotes and eukaryotes is expected to be a useful platform for functional annotation of newly sequenced genomes, including those of complex eukaryotes, and genome-wide evolutionary studies.},

  abstract = {As the association of denitrification with global warming and nitrogen removal from ecosystems has gained attention in recent decades, numerous studies have examined denitrification rates and the distribution of denitrifiers across different environments. In this minireview, reported studies focused on coastal saline environments, including estuaries, mangroves, and hypersaline ecosystems, have been analysed to identify the relationship between denitrification and saline gradients. The analyses of the literature and databases stated the direct effect of salinity on the distribution patterns of denitrifiers. However, few works do not support this hypothesis thus making this topic controversial. The specific mechanisms by which salinity influences denitrifier distribution are not fully understood. Nevertheless, several physical and chemical environmental parameters, in addition to salinity, have been shown to play a role in structuring the denitrifying microbial communities. The prevalence of nirS or nirK denitrifiers in ecosystems is a subject of debate in this work. In general terms, in mesohaline environments, the predominant nitrite reductase is NirS type and, NirK is found predominantly in hypersaline environments. Moreover, the approaches used by different researchers are quite different, resulting in a huge amount of unrelated information, making it difficult to establish comparative analysis. The main techniques used to analyse the distribution of denitrifying populations along salt gradients have been also discussed.},

  abstract = {Ocean–atmosphere gas exchange in the Arctic Ocean is sensitive to global warming because the decrease of sea-ice covered area enhances the exchange. Melting sea ice affects the vertical transport of dissolved gases. Few reports of Arctic Ocean studies have described observations of dissolved N2O or temporal variation of sea-to-atmosphere N2O flux. Therefore, production mechanisms of this greenhouse gas and the stratospheric ozone depleting gas remain unclear. We measured dissolved N2O and its isotopic signatures in the western Arctic shelf region of the Chukchi Sea and surrounding areas during September in 2014 and 2015. In the Chukchi Sea shelf, the N2O concentration was slightly higher than the value expected under sea–air equilibrium in the surface water. It increased with depth to 23 nmol kg−1 in 2014, although it showed a vertically homogeneous distribution in 2015. Isotopocule ratios of N2O, which include 15N-site preference in the N2O molecule as well as elemental N and O isotope ratios, indicate that N2O in the Chukchi Sea shelf is a mixture of N2O produced in the bottom water and that of atmospheric origin. The isotopic signature of excess N2O (δ15Nbulk = −3.6‰ to −1.4‰, δ18O = 61.5‰–63.0‰, SP = 38.7‰–49.0‰) suggests that it is produced by archeal or bacterial nitrification and that it is partly reduced by denitrification. Although further quantitative observations are necessary, the results confirmed that the western Arctic Ocean can act as a source of N2O to the atmosphere when sea-ice cover retreats and the pycnocline is weakened.},

Yet substantial challenges remain, in particular in coping with fragmented genes or genes evolving at different rates after duplication, and in scaling to large datasets. With more and more genomes available, it is necessary to improve the scalability and robustness of orthology inference methods. Results: We present improvements in the OMA algorithm: (i) refining the pairwise orthology inference step to account for same-species paralogs evolving at different rates, and (ii) minimizing errors in the pairwise orthology verification step by testing the consistency of pairwise distance estimates, which can be problematic in the presence of fragmentary sequences. In addition we introduce a more scalable procedure for hierarchical orthologous group (HOG) clustering, which are several orders of magnitude faster on large datasets. Using the Quest for Orthologs consortium orthology benchmark service, we show that these changes translate into substantial improvement on multiple empirical datasets.},

This strategy has yielded model prebiotic reaction networks that elucidate pathways by which relevant compounds can be generated, in some cases, autocatalytically. These prebiotic reaction networks provide a rich platform for further understanding and development of emergent “life-like” behaviours. In this review, recent advances in experimental and analytical procedures associated with classical prebiotic reaction networks, like formose and Miller-Urey, as well as more recent ones are highlighted. Instead of polymeric networks, i.e., those based on nucleic acids or peptides, the focus is on small molecules. The future of prebiotic chemistry lies in better understanding the genuine complexity that can result from reaction networks and the construction of a centralised database of reactions useful for predicting potential network evolution is emphasised.},

Herein, we investigated how cyanamide and 2-aminooxazole, molecules proposed to be present on early Earth and precursors for nonenzymatic ribonucleotide synthesis, mediate the formose reaction using HPLC, LC-MS and               1               H NMR spectroscopy. Cyanamide was shown to delay the exponential phase of the formose reaction by reacting with formose sugars to form 2-aminooxazole and 2-aminooxazolines thereby diverting some of these sugars from the autocatalytic cycle, which nonetheless remains intact. Masses for tetrose and pentose aminooxazolines, precursors for nucleotide synthesis including TNA and RNA, were also observed. The results of this work in the context of the chemoton model are further discussed. Additionally, we highlight other prebiotically plausible molecules that could have mediated the formose reaction and alternative prebiotic autocatalytic systems.},

We characterized an exponential response in N               2               O production to decreasing oxygen between 1 and 30\,μmol O               2               \,l               −1               within and below the oxycline using               15               NO               2               −               , a relationship that held along a 550\,km offshore transect in the North Pacific. Differences in the overall magnitude of N               2               O production were accounted for by archaeal functional gene abundance.

Hence, a significant source of N               2               O, previously described as leakage from bacterial ammonium oxidation, is better described by low-oxygen archaeal production at the oxygen minimum zone’s margins.},

There is no clear evidence yet of a slowing in ocean circulation, although this is predicted for the future. As anthropogenic CO               2               permeates into the ocean, it is making sea water more acidic, to the detriment of surface corals and probably many other calcifiers. Once acidification reaches the deep ocean, it will become more corrosive to CaCO               3               , leading to a considerable reduction in the amount of CaCO               3               accumulating on the deep seafloor. There will be a several thousand-year-long interruption to CaCO               3               sedimentation at many points on the seafloor. A curious feedback in the ocean, carbonate compensation, makes it more likely that global warming and sea-level rise will continue for many millennia after CO               2               emissions cease.},

  abstract = {The Hadean was an enigmatic period in the Earth’s history when ocean formation and the emergence of life may have occurred. However, minimal geological evidence is left from this period. To understand the primordial ocean’s composition, we focused on the ocean’s formation processes from CO2- and HCl-bearing water vapor in the high-temperature atmosphere. When the temperature of the lower atmosphere fell below the critical point, high-temperature rain reached the ground surface. Then, hydrothermal reactions between the subcritical fluid and primordial crust started. Eventually, a liquid ocean emerged on the completely altered crust as the temperature decreased to approximately 25 ◦C. Here, we conducted two experiments and modeling to simulate the reactions of hypothetical primordial crustal rock (basalt or komatiite). The results indicate that the primordial ocean was mildly acidic and rich in CO2, Mg, and Ca relative to Na, irrespective of the rock type, which is different from the modern equivalents. Therefore, unlike the present seawater, the primordial seawater could have been carbonic, bitter, and harsh rather than salty.},

We have tested a one-pot pentose formation and analyzed the products and mechanism in the reaction, using               1               H-NMR and mass spectrometry. Hydroxyapatite (HAp), which consists of phosphate and calcium ions, worked continuously for cross-aldol reactions and Lobry de Bruyn–van Ekenstein transformations to yield ribose from formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde. The continuous reaction proceeds in one pot in hot water only in the presence of a HAp catalyst, without any fine pH control or any complicated condition control at each reaction step. Ribose production by HAp may be a reason why a pentose backbone was incorporated into nucleic acids in the prebiotic world.},

  abstract = {Chronically nitrate-loaded riparian buffer zones show high N2O emissions. Often, a large part of the N2O is emitted from small surface areas, resulting in high spatial variability in these buffer zones. These small surface areas with high N2O emissions (hotspots) need to be investigated to generate knowledge on the factors governing N2O emissions. In this study the N2O emission variability was investigated at different spatial scales. Therefore N2O emissions from three 32 m2 grids were determined in summer and winter. Spatial variation and total emission were determined on three different scales (0.3 m2, 0.018 m2 and 0.0013 m2) at plots with different levels of N2O emissions. Spatial variation was high at all scales determined and highest at the smallest scale. To test possible factors inducing small scale hotspots, soil samples were collected for slurry incubation to determine responses to increased electron donor/acceptor availability. Acetate addition did increase N2O production, but nitrate addition failed to increase total denitrification or net N2O production. N2O production was similar in all soil slurries, independent of their origin from high or low emission soils, indicating that environmental conditions (including physical factors like gas diffusion) rather than microbial community composition governed N2O emission rates.},

  abstract = {A discrete uncoupling process for finite spaces is introduced, called the Markov Cluster Process or the MCL process. The process is the engine for the graph clustering algorithm called the MCL algorithm. The MCL process takes a stochastic matrix as input, and then alternates expansion and inflation, each step defining a stochastic matrix in terms of the previous one. Expansion corresponds with taking the kth power of a stochastic matrix, where k ∈ N. Inflation corresponds with a parametrized operator Γr, r ≥ 0, that maps the set of (column) stochastic matrices onto itself. The image ΓrM is obtained by raising each entry in M to the rth power and rescaling each column to have sum 1 again. In practice the process converges very fast towards a limit that is invariant under both matrix multiplication and inflation, with quadratic convergence around the limit points. The heuristic behind the process is its expected behavior for (Markov) graphs possessing cluster structure. The process is typically applied to the matrix of random walks on a given graph G, and the connected components of (the graph associated with) the process limit generically allow a clustering interpretation of G. The limit is in general extremely sparse and iterands are sparse in a weighted sense, implying that the MCL algorithm is very fast and highly scalable. Several mathematical properties of the MCL process are established. Most notably, the process (and algorithm) iterands posses structural properties generalizing the mapping from process limits onto clusterings. The inflation operator Γr maps the class of matrices that are diagonally similar to a symmetric matrix onto itself. The phrase diagonally positive semi-definite (dpsd) is used for matrices that are diagonally similar to a positive semi-definite matrix. For r ∈ N and for M a stochastic dpsd matrix, the image ΓrM is again dpsd. Determinantal inequalities satisfied by a dpsd matrix M imply a natural ordering among the diagonal elements of M , generalizing the mapping of process limits onto clusterings. The spectrum of Γ∞M is of the form \{0n−k, 1k\}, where k is the number of endclasses of the ordering associated with M , and n is the dimension of M . This attests to the uncoupling effect of the inflation operator.},

However, the impact of the temporal dynamics of environmental conditions upon prebiotic chemical reaction networks has not been investigated. Here, we demonstrate how the magnitude and rate of temporal fluctuations of the catalysts Ca2+ and hydroxide control the product distributions of the formose reaction. Surprisingly, the product compositions of the formose reaction under dynamic conditions deviate significantly from those under steady state conditions. We attribute these compositional changes to the nonuniform propagation of fluctuations through the network, thereby shaping reaction outcomes. An examination of temporal concentration patterns showed that collections of compounds responded collectively to perturbations, indicating that key gating reactions branching from the Breslow cycle may be important responsive features of the formose reaction. Our findings show how the compositions of prebiotic reaction networks were shaped by sequential environmental events, illustrating the necessity for considering the temporal traits of prebiotic environments that supported the origin of life.},

  abstract = {Background: Our current understanding of evolution is so tightly linked to template-dependent replication of DNA and RNA molecules that the old idea from Oparin of a self-reproducing ‘garbage bag’ (’coacervate’) of chemicals that predated fully-fledged cell-like entities seems to be farfetched to most scientists today. However, this is exactly the kind of scheme we propose for how Darwinian evolution could have occurred prior to template replication. Results: We cannot confirm previous claims that autocatalytic sets of organic polymer molecules could undergo evolution in any interesting sense by themselves. While we and others have previously imagined inhibition would result in selectability, we found that it produced multiple attractors in an autocatalytic set that cannot be selected for. Instead, we discovered that if general conditions are satisfied, the accumulation of adaptations in chemical reaction networks can occur. These conditions are the existence of rare reactions producing viable cores (analogous to a genotype), that sustains a molecular periphery (analogous to a phenotype). Conclusions: We conclude that only when a chemical reaction network consists of many such viable cores, can it be evolvable. When many cores are enclosed in a compartment there is competition between cores within the same compartment, and when there are many compartments, there is between-compartment competition due to the phenotypic effects of cores and their periphery at the compartment level. Acquisition of cores by rare chemical events, and loss of cores at division, allows macromutation, limited heredity and selectability, thus explaining how a poor man’s natural selection could have operated prior to genetic templates. This is the only demonstration to date of a mechanism by which pre-template accumulation of adaptation could occur. Reviewers: This article was reviewed by William Martin and Eugene Koonin.},

  abstract = {The RNA-world theory hypothesizes that early Earth life was based on the RNA molecule. However, the notion that ribose, the sugar in RNA, is unstable still casts a serious doubt over this theory. Recently, it has been found that the silicate-mediated formose reaction facilitates the stabilization of ribose. Using accurate quantum chemical calculations, we determined the relative stability of the silicate complexes of arabinose, lyxose, ribose, and xylose with the intent to determine which would form predominantly from a formose-like reaction. Five stereoisomers were investigated for each complex. The stereoisomers of 2:1 ribose-silicate are the more stable ones, to the extent that the least stable of these is even more stable than the most stable stereoisomer of the other 2:1 sugar-silicate complexes. Thus, thermodynamically, a formose-like reaction in the presence of silicate minerals should preferentially form the silicate complex of ribose over the silicate complex of arabinose, lyxose, and xylose.

  author = {Vidaurri, Monica},
  abstract = {As the question of the origins of eukaryotes comes closer to an answer, the interactions between the archaeal ancestor to eukaryotes and environmental, molecular, bacterial, other influences and symbionts have become increasingly relevant. Various studies have pointed towards the Lokiarchaeota as a close archaeal relative to the eukarya. A study by Imachi et al., published in early 2020, was able to decipher the proteome and genome of the Loki and reported an entirely new model for eukaryogenesis due to its findings, thus shifting research of eukaryogenesis away from models focusing on endocytosis and the rapid acquisition of the alphaproteobacteria that would become the mitochondria. Imachi and colleagues proposed that ancestors of the Loki lived symbiotically with other prokaryotes due to its shape, and facilitated molecular transfer between the symbionts as well as the membrane manipulation necessary to allow such transfer, before acquiring a proto-mitochondria over time. This paper will lay out the history of endosymbiosis and the prevailing theory of endocytosis between archaea and alphaproteobacteria, and consolidates the knowns and unknowns up to before the publication of Imachi et al. The findings of their novel study will be discussed, and the knowns and unknowns with respect to these new findings are re-consolidated. The two models of eukaryogenesis are compared and, in moving forward with Imachi and colleagues’ model, probable areas of research to further validate this approach are discussed, as well as potential usage of research tools of other fields to answer the persistent unknowns of how eukaryotes came to be.},

  abstract = {Prebiotic soup” often features in discussions of origins of life research, both as a theoretical concept when discussing abiological pathways to modern biochemical building blocks and, more recently, as a feedstock in prebiotic chemistry experiments focused on discovering emergent, systems-level processes such as polymerization, encapsulation, and evolution. However, until now, little systematic analysis has gone into the design of well-justified prebiotic mixtures, which are needed to facilitate experimental replicability and comparison among researchers. This paper explores principles that should be considered in choosing chemical mixtures for prebiotic chemistry experiments by reviewing the natural environmental conditions that might have created such mixtures and then suggests reasonable guidelines for designing recipes. We discuss both “assembled” mixtures, which are made by mixing reagent grade chemicals, and “synthesized” mixtures, which are generated directly from diversity-generating primary prebiotic syntheses. We discuss different practical concerns including how to navigate the tremendous uncertainty in the chemistry of the early Earth and how to balance the desire for using prebiotically realistic mixtures with experimental tractability and replicability. Examples of two assembled mixtures, one based on materials likely delivered by carbonaceous meteorites and one based on spark discharge synthesis, are presented to illustrate these challenges. We explore alternative procedures for making synthesized mixtures using recursive chemical reaction systems whose outputs attempt to mimic atmospheric and geochemical synthesis. Other experimental conditions such as pH and ionic strength are also considered. We argue that developing a handful of standardized prebiotic recipes may facilitate coordination among researchers and enable the identification of the most promising mechanisms by which complex prebiotic mixtures were “tamed” during the origin of life to give rise to key living processes such as self-propagation, information processing, and adaptive evolution. We end by advocating for the development of a public prebiotic chemistry database containing experimental methods (including soup recipes), results, and analytical pipelines for analyzing complex prebiotic mixtures.},

  abstract = {The ocean's nitrogen cycle is driven by complex microbial transformations, including nitrogen fixation, assimilation, nitrification, anammox and denitrification. Dinitrogen is the most abundant form of nitrogen in sea water but only accessible by nitrogen-fixing microbes. Denitrification and nitrification are both regulated by oxygen concentrations and potentially produce nitrous oxide (N               2               O), a climate-relevant atmospheric trace gas. The world's oceans, including the coastal areas and upwelling areas, contribute about 30 per cent to the atmospheric N               2               O budget and are, therefore, a major source of this gas to the atmosphere. Human activities now add more nitrogen to the environment than is naturally fixed. More than half of the nitrogen reaches the coastal ocean via river input and atmospheric deposition, of which the latter affects even remote oceanic regions. A nitrogen budget for the coastal and open ocean, where inputs and outputs match rather well, is presented. Furthermore, predicted climate change will impact the expansion of the oceans' oxygen minimum zones, the productivity of surface waters and presumably other microbial processes, with unpredictable consequences for the cycling of nitrogen. Nitrogen cycling is closely intertwined with that of carbon, phosphorous and other biologically important elements via biological stoichiometric requirements. This linkage implies that human alterations of nitrogen cycling are likely to have major consequences for other biogeochemical processes and ecosystem functions and services.},

  abstract = {Ammonia-oxidizing archaea are ubiquitous in marine and terrestrial environments and now thought to be significant contributors to carbon and nitrogen cycling. The isolation of               Candidatus               “               Nitrosopumilus maritimus               ” strain SCM1 provided the opportunity for linking its chemolithotrophic physiology with a genomic inventory of the globally distributed archaea. Here we report the 1,645,259-bp closed genome of strain SCM1, revealing highly copper-dependent systems for ammonia oxidation and electron transport that are distinctly different from known ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Consistent with in situ isotopic studies of marine archaea, the genome sequence indicates               N. maritimus               grows autotrophically using a variant of the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutryrate pathway for carbon assimilation, while maintaining limited capacity for assimilation of organic carbon. This unique instance of archaeal biosynthesis of the osmoprotectant ectoine and an unprecedented enrichment of multicopper oxidases, thioredoxin-like proteins, and transcriptional regulators points to an organism responsive to environmental cues and adapted to handling reactive copper and nitrogen species that likely derive from its distinctive biochemistry. The conservation of               N. maritimus               gene content and organization within marine metagenomes indicates that the unique physiology of these specialized oligophiles may play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen.},

The processes underpinning the N               2               O flux, however, remain poorly understood, leading to large uncertainties in assessing global N               2               O budgets. Using a suite of nitrogen isotope labeling experiments, we show that multiple processes contribute to N               2               O production throughout the estuarine-coastal gradient, sustaining intensive N               2               O flux to the atmosphere. Unexpectedly, denitrification, rather than ammonia oxidation as previously assumed, constitutes the major source of N               2               O in well-oxygenated coastal waters. Size-fractionated manipulation experiments with gene analysis further reveal niche partitioning of ammonia oxidizers and denitrifiers across the particle size spectrum; denitrification dominated on large particles and ammonia oxidizers on small particles. Total N               2               O production rate increases with substrate and particle concentrations, suggesting a crucial interplay between nutrients and particles in controlling N               2               O production. The controlling factors identified here may help understand climate feedback mechanisms between human activity and coastal oceans.},

  abstract = {Ambient conditions shape microbiome responses to both short- and long-duration environment changes through processes including physiological acclimation, compositional shifts, and evolution. Thus, we predict that microbial communities inhabiting locations with larger diel, episodic, and annual variability in temperature and pH should be less sensitive to shifts in these climate-change factors. To test this hypothesis, we compared responses of surface ocean microbes from more variable (nearshore) and more constant (offshore) sites to short-term factorial warming (+3 °C) and/or acidification (pH −0.3). In all cases, warming alone significantly altered microbial community composition, while acidification had a minor influence. Compared with nearshore microbes, warmed offshore microbiomes exhibited larger changes in community composition, phylotype abundances, respiration rates, and metatranscriptomes, suggesting increased sensitivity of microbes from the less-variable environment. Moreover, while warming increased respiration rates, offshore metatranscriptomes yielded evidence of thermal stress responses in protein synthesis, heat shock proteins, and regulation. Future oceans with warmer waters may enhance overall metabolic and biogeochemical rates, but they will host altered microbial communities, especially in relatively thermally stable regions of the oceans.},

As coastal ecosystems are especially impacted by elevated nitrogen, we investigated controls on N               2               O production mechanisms in intertidal sediments using novel isotopic approaches and microsensors in flow-through incubations. Here we show that during incubations with elevated nitrate, increased N               2               O fluxes are not mediated by direct bacterial activity, but instead are largely catalysed by fungal denitrification and/or abiotic reactions (e.g., chemodenitrification). Results of these incubations shed new light on nitrogen cycling complexity and possible factors underlying variability of N               2               O fluxes, driven in part by fungal respiration and/or iron redox cycling. As both processes exhibit N               2               O yields typically far greater than direct bacterial production, these results emphasize their possibly substantial, yet widely overlooked, role in N               2               O fluxes, especially in redox-dynamic sediments of coastal ecosystems.},

  abstract = {▪ Abstract\enspace{} Microbes are recognized as important components of the Earth system, playing key roles in controlling the composition of the atmosphere and surface waters, forming the basis of the marine food web, and the cycling of chemicals in the ocean. A revolution in microbial ecology has occurred in the past 15–20 years with the advent of rapid methods for discovering and sequencing the genes of uncultivated microbes from natural environments. Initially based on sequences from the 16S rRNA gene, this revolution made it possible to identify microorganisms without first cultivating them, to discover and characterize the immense previously unsuspected diversity of the microbial world, and to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among microbes. Subsequent focus on functional genes, those that encode enzymes that catalyze biogeochemical transformations, and current work on larger DNA fragments and entire genomes make it possible to link microbial diversity to ecosystem function. These approaches have yielded insights into the regulation of microbial activity and proof of the microbial role in biogeochemical processes previously unknown. Questions raised by the molecular revolution, which are now the focus of microbial ecology research, include the significance of microbial diversity and redundancy to biogeochemical processes and ecosystem function.},

We used a comprehensive dataset of more than 5000 prokaryotic species from which we derived the metabolic networks. We compute the scope from the reconstructed graphs, which is the set of all metabolites and reactions that can potentially be synthesized when provided with external metabolites. We show using machine learning techniques that the scope is an excellent predictor of taxonomic and environmental variables, namely growth temperature, oxygen tolerance, and habitat. In the literature, metabolites and pathways are rarely used to discriminate species. We make use of the scope underlying structure—metabolites and pathways—to construct the predictive models, giving additional information on the important metabolic pathways needed to discriminate the species, which is often absent in other metabolic network properties. For example, in the particular case of growth temperature, glutathione biosynthesis pathways are specific to species growing in cold environments, whereas tungsten metabolism is specific to species in warm environments, as was hinted in current literature. From a machine learning perspective, the scope is able to reduce the dimension of our data, and can thus be considered as an interpretable graph embedding.},

These factors place constraints on the types of Hadean environment in which life could have emerged. Many locations, ranging from hydrothermal vents and pumice rafts, through volcanic-hosted splash pools to continental springs and rivers, have been proposed for the emergence of life on Earth, each with respective advantages and certain disadvantages. However, there is another, hitherto unrecognized environment that, on the Hadean Earth (4.5–4.0 Ga), would have been more important than any other in terms of spatial and temporal scale: the sedimentary layer between oceanic crust and seawater. Using as an example sediments from the 3.5–3.33 Ga Barberton Greenstone Belt, South Africa, analogous at least on a local scale to those of the Hadean eon, we document constant permeation of the porous, carbonaceous, and reactive sedimentary layer by hydrothermal fluids emanating from the crust. This partially UV-protected, subaqueous sedimentary environment, characterized by physical and chemical gradients, represented a widespread system of miniature chemical reactors in which the production and complexification of prebiotic molecules could have led to the origin of life.

  abstract = {Significance             The Archaea represent a primary domain of cellular life, play major roles in modern-day biogeochemical cycles, and are central to debates about the origin of eukaryotic cells. However, understanding their origins and evolutionary history is challenging because of the immense time spans involved. Here we apply a new approach that harnesses the information in patterns of gene family evolution to find the root of the archaeal tree and to resolve the metabolism of the earliest archaeal cells. Our approach robustly distinguishes between published rooting hypotheses, suggests that the first Archaea were anaerobes that may have fixed carbon via the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, and quantifies the cumulative impact of horizontal transfer on archaeal genome evolution.           ,                             A root for the archaeal tree is essential for reconstructing the metabolism and ecology of early cells and for testing hypotheses that propose that the eukaryotic nuclear lineage originated from within the Archaea; however, published studies based on outgroup rooting disagree regarding the position of the archaeal root. Here we constructed a consensus unrooted archaeal topology using protein concatenation and a multigene supertree method based on 3,242 single gene trees, and then rooted this tree using a recently developed model of genome evolution. This model uses evidence from gene duplications, horizontal transfers, and gene losses contained in 31,236 archaeal gene families to identify the most likely root for the tree. Our analyses support the monophyly of DPANN (Diapherotrites, Parvarchaeota, Aenigmarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota, Nanohaloarchaea), a recently discovered cosmopolitan and genetically diverse lineage, and, in contrast to previous work, place the tree root between DPANN and all other Archaea. The sister group to DPANN comprises the Euryarchaeota and the TACK Archaea, including               Lokiarchaeum               , which our analyses suggest are monophyletic sister lineages. Metabolic reconstructions on the rooted tree suggest that early Archaea were anaerobes that may have had the ability to reduce CO               2               to acetate via the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway. In contrast to proposals suggesting that genome reduction has been the predominant mode of archaeal evolution, our analyses infer a relatively small-genomed archaeal ancestor that subsequently increased in complexity via gene duplication and horizontal gene transfer.},

Water is the most common reactant in the autotrophic core, indicating that the core arose in an aqueous environment. Seventy-seven core reactions involve the hydrolysis of high-energy phosphate bonds, furthermore suggesting the presence of a non-enzymatic and highly exergonic chemical reaction capable of continuously synthesizing activated phosphate bonds. CO2 is the most common carbon-containing compound in the core. An abundance of NADH and NADPH-dependent redox reactions in the autotrophic core, the central role of CO2, and the circumstance that the core’s main products are far more reduced than CO2 indicate that the core arose in a highly reducing environment. The chemical reactions of the autotrophic core suggest that it arose from H2, inorganic carbon, and NH3 in an aqueous environment marked by highly reducing and continuously far from equilibrium conditions. Such conditions are very similar to those found in serpentinizing hydrothermal systems.},

Lipmann suggested that PPi could have been an ancient currency or a possible environmental source of metabolic energy at origins, while Kornberg proposed that PPi vectorializes metabolism because ubiquitous pyrophosphatases render PPi forming reactions kinetically irreversible. To test those ideas, we investigated the reactions that consume phosphoanhydride bonds among the 402 reactions of the universal biosynthetic core that generates amino acids, nucleotides, and cofactors from H2, CO2, and NH3. We find that 36\% of the core’s phosphoanhydride hydrolyzing reactions generate PPi, while no reactions use PPi as an energy currency. The polymerization reactions that generate \textasciitilde 80\% of cell mass – protein, RNA, and DNA synthesis – all generate PPi, while none use PPi as an energy source. In typical prokaryotic cells, aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (AARS) underlie \textasciitilde 80\% of PPi production. We show that the irreversibility of the AARS reaction is a kinetic, not a thermodynamic effect. The data indicate that PPi is not an ancient energy currency and probably never was. Instead, PPi hydrolysis is an ancient mechanism that imparts irreversibility, as Kornberg suggested, functioning like a ratchet’s pawl to vectorialize the life process toward growth. The two anhydride bonds in nucleoside triphosphates offer ATP-cleaving enzymes an option to impart either thermodynamic control (Pi formation) or kinetic control (PPi formation) upon reactions. This dual capacity explains why nature chose the triphosphate moiety of ATP as biochemistry’s universal energy currency.},

  abstract = {Though all theories for the origin of life require a source of energy to promote primordial chemical reactions, the nature of energy that drove the emergence of metabolism at origins is still debated. We reasoned that evidence for the nature of energy at origins should be preserved in the biochemical reactions of life itself, whereby changes in free energy, G, which determine whether a reaction can go forward or not, should help specify the source. By calculating values of G across the conserved and universal core of 402 individual reactions that synthesize amino acids, nucleotides and cofactors from H2, CO2, NH3, H2S and phosphate in modern cells, we find that 95–97\% of these reactions are exergonic ( G ≤ 0 kJ·mol−1) at pH 7-10 and 80-100◦C under nonequilibrium conditions with H2 replacing biochemical reductants. While 23\% of the core’s reactions involve ATP hydrolysis, 77\% are ATP-independent, thermodynamically driven by G of reactions involving carbon bonds. We identified 174 reactions that are exergonic by –20 to –300 kJ·mol−1 at pH 9 and 80◦C and that fall into ten reaction types: six pterin dependent alkyl or acyl transfers, ten S-adenosylmethionine dependent alkyl transfers, four acyl phosphate hydrolyses, 14 thioester hydrolyses, 30 decarboxylations, 35 ring closure reactions, 31 aromatic ring formations, and 44 carbon reductions by reduced nicotinamide, flavins, ferredoxin, or formate. The 402 reactions of the biosynthetic core trace to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), and reveal that synthesis of LUCA’s chemical constituents required no external energy inputs such as electric discharge, UV-light or phosphide minerals. The biosynthetic reactions of LUCA uncover a natural thermodynamic tendency of metabolism to unfold from energy released by reactions of H2, CO2, NH3, H2S, and phosphate.},

These approaches have been used for the analysis of cells in situ, within tissue, and confirmed existing and uncovered new models of cellular microenvironments in human disease. This has been achieved by the development of both imaging modality specific and multimodal solutions for cellular segmentation, thus addressing the fundamental requirement for high quality and reproducible cell segmentation in images from immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and histological stains. The expansive landscape of cell types-from a variety of species, organs and cellular states-has required a concerted effort to build libraries of annotated cells for training data and novel solutions for leveraging annotations across imaging modalities and in some cases led to questioning the requirement for single cell demarcation all together. Unfortunately, bleeding-edge approaches are often confined to a few experts with the necessary domain knowledge. However, freely available, and open-source tools and libraries of trained machine learning models have been made accessible to researchers in the biomedical sciences as software pipelines, plugins for open-source and free desktop and web-based software solutions. The future holds exciting possibilities with expanding machine learning models for segmentation via the brute-force addition of new training data or the implementation of novel network architectures, the use of machine and deep learning in cell and neighborhood classification for uncovering cellular microenvironments, and the development of new strategies for the use of machine and deep learning in biomedical research.},

  abstract = {Nitrifier denitrification is the reduction of nitrite (NO2−) by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. This process may account for up to 100\% of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from ammonium (NH4+) in soils and is more significant than classical denitrification under some conditions. Investigations of nitrifier denitrification have expanded in the last decade but many aspects are still not understood. In this review, we revisit our 2001 paper, present a comprehensive summary of current knowledge concerning nitrifier denitrification, and identify the many research needs. Nitrifier denitrification can be distinguished from other routes of N2O production using isotopic methods: either isotopomer techniques or a combination of 15N and 18O tracers. Our understanding of the regulation and conditions favouring nitrifier denitrification has improved over the last decade as a result of adopting molecular and modelling approaches. Environments low in oxygen, and especially those with fluctuating aerobic-anaerobic conditions, promote N2O production by nitrifier denitrification. Also, large NO2− concentrations, which often arise following inputs of ammonium or urea, may be linked to changes in aerobicity and high pH and favour nitrifier denitrification. The effects of temperature and carbon contents on nitrifier denitrification are incompletely understood and future research needs include: the study of pathways similar to nitrifier denitrification in archaea and nitrite oxidizers; the effects of interactions among microorganisms and between microorganism and plants; and the regulation and importance of the enzymes involved. A comparison and evaluation of the methods used for differentiating the sources of N2O is urgently needed. Furthermore, results from studies of freshwater and marine environments as well as wastewater treatment, where nitrifier denitrification is also known as nitrous aerobic denitritation (up to N2O) or aerobic denitritation (up to N2), will further advance our understanding.},

  abstract = {Nitri®er denitri®cation is the pathway of nitri®cation in which ammonia (NH3) is oxidized to nitrite (NO22) followed by the reduction of NO22 to nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) and molecular nitrogen (N2). The transformations are carried out by autotrophic nitri®ers. Thus, nitri®er denitri®cation differs from coupled nitri®cation±denitri®cation, where denitri®ers reduce NO22 or nitrate (NO32) that was produced by nitri®ers. Nitri®er denitri®cation contributes to the development of the greenhouse gas N2O and also causes losses of fertilizer nitrogen in agricultural soils. In this review article, present knowledge about nitri®er denitri®cation is summarized in order to give an exact de®nition, to spread awareness of its pathway and controlling factors and to identify areas of research needed to improve global N2O budgets. Due to experimental dif®culties and a lack of awareness of nitri®er denitri®cation, not much is known about this mechanism of N2O production. The few measurements carried out so far attribute up to 30\% of the total N2O production to nitri®er denitri®cation. Low oxygen conditions coupled with low organic carbon contents of soils favour this pathway as might low pH. As nitri®er denitri®cation can lead to substantial N2O emissions, there is a need to quantify this pathway in different soils under different conditions. New insights attained through quanti®cation experiments should be used in the improvement of computer models to de®ne sets of conditions that show where and when nitri®er denitri®cation is a signi®cant source of N2O. This may subsequently render the development of guidelines for low-emission farming practices necessary. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background: The KEGG PATHWAY database provides a plethora of pathways for a diversity of organisms. All pathway components are directly linked to other KEGG databases, such as KEGG COMPOUND or KEGG REACTION. Therefore, the pathways can be extended with an enormous amount of information and provide a foundation for initial structural modeling approaches. As a drawback, KGML-formatted KEGG pathways are primarily designed for visualization purposes and often omit important details for the sake of a clear arrangement of its entries. Thus, a direct conversion into systems biology models would produce incomplete and erroneous models. Results: Here, we present a precise method for processing and converting KEGG pathways into initial metabolic and signaling models encoded in the standardized community pathway formats SBML (Levels 2 and 3) and BioPAX (Levels 2 and 3). This method involves correcting invalid or incomplete KGML content, creating complete and valid stoichiometric reactions, translating relations to signaling models and augmenting the pathway content with various information, such as cross-references to Entrez Gene, OMIM, UniProt ChEBI, and many more. Finally, we compare several existing conversion tools for KEGG pathways and show that the conversion from KEGG to BioPAX does not involve a loss of information, whilst lossless translations to SBML can only be performed using SBML Level 3, including its recently proposed qualitative models and groups extension packages. Conclusions: Building correct BioPAX and SBML signaling models from the KEGG database is a unique characteristic of the proposed method. Further, there is no other approach that is able to appropriately construct metabolic models from KEGG pathways, including correct reactions with stoichiometry. The resulting initial models, which contain valid and comprehensive SBML or BioPAX code and a multitude of cross-references, lay the foundation to facilitate further modeling steps.},

  abstract = {Modern cells embody metabolic networks containing thousands of elements and form autocatalytic sets of molecules that produce copies of themselves. How the first self-sustaining metabolic networks arose at life's origin is a major open question. Autocatalytic sets smaller than metabolic networks were proposed as transitory intermediates at the origin of life, but evidence for their role in prebiotic evolution is lacking. Here, we identify reflexively autocatalytic food-generated networks (RAFs)—self-sustaining networks that collectively catalyse all their reactions—embedded within microbial metabolism. RAFs in the metabolism of ancient anaerobic autotrophs that live from H               2               and CO               2               provided with small-molecule catalysts generate acetyl-CoA as well as amino acids and bases, the monomeric components of protein and RNA, but amino acids and bases without organic catalysts do not generate metabolic RAFs. This suggests that RAFs identify attributes of biochemical origins conserved in metabolic networks. RAFs are consistent with an autotrophic origin of metabolism and furthermore indicate that autocatalytic chemical networks preceded proteins and RNA in evolution. RAFs uncover intermediate stages in the emergence of metabolic networks, narrowing the gaps between early Earth chemistry and life.},

Our results indicate that LBCA performed gluconeogenesis towards cell wall synthesis, and~had numerous RNA modifications and multifunctional enzymes that permitted life with low gene content. In accordance with recent findings for LUCA and LACA, analyses of thousands of individual gene trees indicate that LBCA was rod-shaped and the first lineage to diverge from the ancestral bacterial stem was most similar to modern Clostridia, followed by other autotrophs that harbor the acetyl-CoA pathway.},

  abstract = {The discovery of complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) refutes the century-old paradigm that nitrification requires the activity of two types of microbes. Determining the distribution and abundance of comammox in various environments is important for revealing the ecology of microbial nitrification within the global nitrogen cycle. In this study, the ubiquity and diversity of comammox were analyzed for samples from different types of environments, including soil, sediment, sludge, and water. The results of a two-step PCR using highly degenerate primers (THDPPCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) supported the relatively high abundance of comammox in nearly half of all samples tested, sometimes even outnumbering canonical ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). In addition, a relatively high proportion of comammox in tap and coastal water samples was confirmed via analysis of metagenomic data sets in public databases. The diversity of comammox was estimated by comammox-specific partial nested PCR amplification of the ammonia monooxygenase subunit A (amoA) gene, and phylogenetic analysis of comammox AmoA clearly showed a split of clade A into clades A.1 and A.2, with the proportions of clades A.1, A.2, and B differing among the various environmental samples. Moreover, compared to the amoA genes of AOB and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), the comammox amoA gene exhibited higher diversity indices. The ubiquitous distribution and high diversity of comammox indicate that they are likely overlooked contributors to nitrification in various ecosystems.},

However, the underlying mechanism of N               2               O emission from denitrification in paddy soils is yet to be elucidated. In this study, the potential N               2               O emission rate, enzymatic activity for N               2               O production and reduction, gene abundance, and community composition during denitrification were investigated using the               15               N isotope tracer technique combined with slurry incubation, enzymatic activity detection, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and metagenomic sequencing. Results of incubation experiments showed that the average potential N               2               O emission rates were 0.51 ± 0.20 μmol⋅N⋅kg               –1               ⋅h               –1               , which constituted 2.16 ± 0.85\% of the denitrification end-products. The enzymatic activity for N               2               O production was 2.77–8.94 times than that for N               2               O reduction, indicating an imbalance between N               2               O production and reduction.

Results of metagenomic analysis showed that, although Proteobacteria was the common phylum for denitrification genes, other dominant community compositions varied for different denitrification genes. Gammaproteobacteria and other phyla containing the               nor               B gene without               nos               Z genes, including Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Desulfobacterota, Cyanobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Myxococcus, may contribute to N               2               O emission from paddy soils. Our results suggest that denitrification is highly modular, with different microbial communities collaborating to complete the denitrification process, thus resulting in an emission estimation of 13.67 ± 5.44 g N               2               O⋅m               –2               ⋅yr               –1               in surface paddy soils.},

  abstract = {Carbohydrate biosynthesis is fundamental to modern terrestrial biochemistry, but how this collection of metabolic pathways originated remains an open question. Prebiotic sugar synthesis has focused primarily on the formose reaction and Kiliani−Fischer homologation; however, how they can transition to extant biochemical pathways has not been studied. Herein, a nonenzymatic pathway for pentose production with similar chemical transformations as those of the pentose phosphate pathway is demonstrated. Starting from a C6 aldonate, namely, gluconate, nonselective chemical oxidation yields a mixture of 2-oxo-, 4oxo-, 5-oxo-, and 6-oxo-uronate regioisomers. Regardless at which carbinol the oxidation takes place, carbonyl migration enables β-decarboxylation to yield pentoses. In comparison, the pentose phosphate pathway selectively oxidizes 6-phosphogluconate to afford the 3-oxouronate derivative, which undergoes facile subsequent β-decarboxylation and carbonyl migration to afford ribose 5-phosphate. The similarities between these two pathways and the potential implications for prebiotic chemistry and protometabolism are discussed.},

  abstract = {As a new wastewater biological nitrogen removal process, anammox and partial denitrification coupling not only plays a significant role in the nitrogen cycle, but also holds high engineering application value.           ,                             As a new wastewater biological nitrogen removal process, anammox and partial denitrification coupling not only plays a significant role in the nitrogen cycle, but also holds high engineering application value. Because anammox and some denitrifying bacteria are coupled under harsh living conditions, certain operating conditions and mechanisms of the coupling process are not clear; thus, it is more difficult to control the process, which is why the process has not been widely applied. This paper analyzes the research focusing on the coupling process in recent years, including anammox and partial denitrification coupling process inhibitors such as nitrogen (NH               4               +               , NO               2               −               ), organics (toxic and non-toxic organics), and salts. The mechanism of substrate removal in anammox and partial denitrification coupling nitrogen removal is described in detail. Due to the differences in process methods, experimental conditions, and sludge choices between the rapid start-up and stable operation stages of the reactor, there are significant differences in substrate inhibition. Multiple process parameters (such as pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, redox potential, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and sludge) can be adjusted to improve the coupling of anammox and partial denitrification to modify nitrogen removal performance.},

  abstract = {Endosymbiosis and organellogenesis are virtually unknown among prokaryotes. The single presumed example is the endosymbiogenetic origin of mitochondria, which is hidden behind the event horizon of the last eukaryotic common ancestor. While eukaryotes are monophyletic, it is unlikely that during billions of years, there were no other prokaryote–prokaryote endosymbioses as symbiosis is extremely common among prokaryotes, e.g., in biofilms. Therefore, it is even more precarious to draw conclusions about potentially existing (or once existing) prokaryotic endosymbioses based on a single example. It is yet unknown if the bacterial endosymbiont was captured by a prokaryote or by a (proto-)eukaryote, and if the process of internalization was parasitic infection, slow engulfment, or phagocytosis. In this review, we accordingly explore multiple mechanisms and processes that could drive the evolution of unicellular microbial symbioses with a special attention to prokaryote–prokaryote interactions and to the mitochondrion, possibly the single prokaryotic endosymbiosis that turned out to be a major evolutionary transition. We investigate the ecology and evolutionary stability of inter-species microbial interactions based on dependence, physical proximity, cost–benefit budget, and the types of benefits, investments, and controls. We identify challenges that had to be conquered for the mitochondrial host to establish a stable eukaryotic lineage. Any assumption about the initial interaction of the mitochondrial ancestor and its contemporary host based solely on their modern relationship is rather perilous. As a result, we warn against assuming an initial mutually beneficial interaction based on modern mitochondria–host cooperation. This assumption is twice fallacious: (i) endosymbioses are known to evolve from exploitative interactions and (ii) cooperativity does not necessarily lead to stable mutualism. We point out that the lack of evidence so far on the evolution of endosymbiosis from mutual syntrophy supports the idea that mitochondria emerged from an exploitative (parasitic or phagotrophic) interaction rather than from syntrophy.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is used in many of life’s fundamental biomolecules, and it is also a participant in environmental redox chemistry. Biogeochemical processes control the amount and form of N available to organisms (“fixed” N). These interacting processes result in N acting as the proximate limiting nutrient in most surface environments. Here, we review the global biogeochemical cycle of N and its anthropogenic perturbation. We introduce important reservoirs and processes affecting N in the environment, focusing on the ocean, in which N cycling is more generalizable than in terrestrial systems, which are more heterogeneous. Particular attention is given to processes that create and destroy fixed N because these comprise the fixed N input/output budget, the most universal control on environmental N availability. We discuss preindustrial N budgets for terrestrial and marine systems and their modern-day alteration by N inputs from human activities. We summarize evidence indicating that the simultaneous roles of N as a required biomass constituent and an environmental redox intermediate lead to stabilizing feedbacks that tend to blunt the impact of N cycle perturbations at larger spatiotemporal scales, particularly in marine systems. As a result of these feedbacks, the anthropogenic “N problem” is distinct from the “carbon dioxide problem” in being more local and less global, more immediate and less persistent.},

This process may be performed entirely by complete denitrifiers capable of all four enzymatic steps, but many organisms possess only partial denitrification pathways, either producing or consuming key intermediates such as the greenhouse gas N2O. Metagenomics and marker gene surveys have revealed a diversity of denitrification genes within ODZs, but whether these genes co-occur within complete or partial denitrifiers and the identities of denitrifying taxa remain open questions. We assemble genomes from metagenomes spanning the ETNP and Arabian Sea, and map these metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to 56 metagenomes from all three major ODZs to reveal the predominance of partial denitrifiers, particularly single-step denitrifiers. We find niche differentiation among nitrogen-cycling organisms, with communities performing each nitrogen transformation distinct in taxonomic identity and motility traits. Our collection of 962 MAGs presents the largest collection of pelagic ODZ microorganisms and reveals a clearer picture of the nitrogen cycling community within this environment.},

  abstract = {The natural selection of ribose as the exclusive sugar for RNA has been one of the greatest puzzles in the origins of life. Here, we present a plausible solution to this problem that circumvents the limitations of previous hypotheses, inspired by the unique retention properties of ribose in ligand-exchange chromatography. It is discovered that metal cations and clay minerals have a synergistic effect to selectively bind to ribose against other monosaccharides. Excitingly, ribose can be continuously and highly selectively enriched on metal-doped-clays (MDCs) from a complex Formose mixture, which could be the origin of its rise to prominence. Prebiotic scenarios of the dynamic isolation of ribose from sugar mixture are simulated with microflow technology. The MDC-retained ribose exhibits long-term stability for the upcoming nucleosidation reactions. Computational studies help elucidate the unique stability of the ribose-MDC complex. MDC also promotes the 50-phosphorylation of nucleosides with greater yield and selectivity than reported.},

  abstract = {The continuous increase of nitrous oxide (N               2               O) abundance in the atmosphere is a global concern. Multiple pathways of N               2               O production occur in soil, but their significance and dependence on oxygen (O               2               ) availability and nitrogen (N) fertilizer source are poorly understood. We examined N               2               O and nitric oxide (NO) production under 21\%, 3\%, 1\%, 0.5\%, and 0\% (vol/vol) O               2               concentrations following urea or ammonium sulfate [(NH               4               )               2               SO               4               ] additions in loam, clay loam, and sandy loam soils that also contained ample nitrate. The contribution of the ammonia (NH               3               ) oxidation pathways (nitrifier nitrification, nitrifier denitrification, and nitrification-coupled denitrification) and heterotrophic denitrification (HD) to N               2               O production was determined in 36-h incubations in microcosms by               15               N-               18               O isotope and NH               3               oxidation inhibition (by 0.01\% acetylene) methods. Nitrous oxide and NO production via NH               3               oxidation pathways increased as O               2               concentrations decreased from 21\% to 0.5\%. At low (0.5\% and 3\%) O               2               concentrations, nitrifier denitrification contributed between 34\% and 66\%, and HD between 34\% and 50\% of total N               2               O production. Heterotrophic denitrification was responsible for all N               2               O production at 0\% O               2               . Nitrifier denitrification was the main source of N               2               O production from ammonical fertilizer under low O               2               concentrations with urea producing more N               2               O than (NH               4               )               2               SO               4               additions. These findings challenge established thought attributing N               2               O emissions from soils with high water content to HD due to presumably low O               2               availability. Our results imply that management practices that increase soil aeration, e.g., reducing compaction and enhancing soil structure, together with careful selection of fertilizer sources and/or nitrification inhibitors, could decrease N               2               O production in agricultural soils.},

  abstract = {Summary                            The distribution and importance of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) and nitrite‐dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (n‐damo) have been identified in aquatic ecosystems; their role in agricultural upland soils however has not yet been well investigated. In this study, we examined spatio‐temporal distributions of anammox and n‐damo bacteria in soil profiles (300~cm depth) from an agricultural upland. Monitoring nitrogen (N) conversion activity using isotope‐tracing techniques over the course of one year showed denitrification (99.0\% N‐loss in the winter and 85.0\% N‐loss in the summer) predominated over anammox (1.0\% N‐loss in the winter and 14.4\% N‐loss in the summer) and n‐damo (0.6\% N‐loss in the winter) in surface soils (0–20~cm). While below 20~cm depth, N‐loss was dominated by anammox (79.4~±~14.3\% in the winter and 65.4~±~12.5\% in the summer) and n‐damo was not detected. Phylogenetic analysis showed that               Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans               dominated the anammox community in the surface soil and               Candidatus Brocadia fulgida               dominated below 20~cm depth. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA), another nitrite reduction process, was found to play a limited role (4.9~±~3.5\%) in the surface soil compared with denitrification; below 80~cm DNRA rates were much higher than rates of anammox and denitrification. Ammonium oxidation was the main source of                              above 80~cm (70.9~±~23.3\%), the key influencing factor on anammox rates, and nitrate reduction (100\%) was the main                              source below 80~cm. Considering the anammox, n‐damo and denitrification rates as a whole in the sampled soil profile, denitrification is still the main N‐loss process in upland soils.},

Here we build a reference phylogeny of 10,575 evenly-sampled bacterial and archaeal genomes, based on a comprehensive set of 381 markers, using multiple strategies. Our trees indicate remarkably closer evolutionary proximity between Archaea and Bacteria than previous estimates that were limited to fewer “core” genes, such as the ribosomal proteins. The robustness of the results was tested with respect to several variables, including taxon and site sampling, amino acid substitution heterogeneity and saturation, non-vertical evolution, and the impact of exclusion of candidate phyla radiation (CPR) taxa. Our results provide an updated view of domain-level relationships.},

  title = {Functional and Evolutionary Significance of Unknown Genes from Uncultivated Taxa},
  abstract = {Most microbes on our planet remain uncultured and poorly studied. Recent efforts to catalog their genetic diversity have revealed that a significant fraction of the observed microbial genes are functional and evolutionary untraceable, lacking homologs in reference databases. Despite their potential biological value, these apparently unrelated orphan genes from uncultivated taxa have been routinely discarded in metagenomics surveys. Here, we analyzed a global multi-habitat dataset covering 151,697 medium and high-quality metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs), 5,969 single-amplified genomes (SAGs), and 19,642 reference genomes, and identified 413,335 highly curated novel protein families under strong purifying selection out of previously considered orphan genes. These new protein families, representing a three-fold increase over the total number of prokaryotic orthologous groups described to date, spread out across the prokaryote phylogeny, can span multiple habitats, and are notably overrepresented in recently discovered taxa. By genomic context analysis, we pinpointed thousands of unknown protein families to phylogenetically conserved operons linked to energy production, xenobiotic metabolism and microbial resistance. Most remarkably, we found 980 previously neglected protein families that can accurately distinguish entire uncultivated phyla, classes, and orders, likely representing synapomorphic traits that fostered their divergence. The systematic curation and evolutionary analysis of the unique genetic repertoire of uncultivated taxa opens new avenues for understanding the biology and ecological roles of poorly explored lineages at a global scale.},
