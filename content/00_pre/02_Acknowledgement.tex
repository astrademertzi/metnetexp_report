    \normalsize\emph{There is a lot of appreciation to be given\\to every single person who supported me during this project.\\My deepest gratitude goes to my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Shawn E. McGlynn,\\without whom this internship abroad would not have been possible. Thank you, Shawn,\\for enabling me to fulfill my dream of living in Japan; thank you for your support, kindness,\\and all the fun discussions we have had throughout these past six months. I am also grateful to\\Hayate Hirai, M.Sc., for helping with the supercomputer analyses my computer was too slow to handle and for sharing his knowledge on metabolic network expansion, without which I would have been lost in the empty space of sparse matrices. I would also like to thank Prof. Dr. Wilhelm T.S. Huck,\\for his willingness to support my stay abroad and supervise this internship, and Onassis Foundation, for believing in my abilities enough to fund the entirety of my M.Sc. studies.\\Finally, I would like to express my deepest gratitude and love\\to everyone, old and new, who made my stay in Japan\\bearable, fun, and hopefully\\unforgettable.}
