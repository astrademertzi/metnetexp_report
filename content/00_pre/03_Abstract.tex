We hypothesize that the MNE algorithm's nature is predetermined rather than evolution-like. Our phylogenetically constrained analysis demonstrates that the expansion process depends entirely on the nature, topology, and number of seeds used, reflecting the flow of chemical information within the network.

Here, we explore the nature of MNE by reconstructing metabolic networks of the Last Archaeal Common Ancestor (LACA) for multiple datasets of varying taxonomic resolution, and investigate the effect of taxon sampling on the expansion process. We hypothesize that the expansion process is predetermined rather than evolution-like, and that the flow of chemical information within the network is solely dependent on the nature, topology, and number of seeds used for expansion.
